# Physics Notes
a collaborative Physics note taking system native on Obsidian.
_________________
Using Obsidian Git, we will have the ability to share, collaborate, and organize our physics notes, references, and practice papers to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of our studying. The goal is to have a comprehensive course outline complete with notes for various physics classes and topics.
By the time you are able to read this file, you are most likely already connected to the repository, either as an editor or a reader. Obsidian may seem overwhelming at first, but the power of this resource is unmatched.
# For Editors
## Adding files to the Repository
1. Click on "Open Git Source Control" on task bar (left hand vertical bar.) The window will appear on the right.
2. After making changes in the document, they will appear under the "Changes" tab on the Git Source Control.
3. To receive work done by other collaborators, press the "pull" icon (3rd from right), and the Obsidian will automatically update.
4. To push the work done to other collaborators, first you must press the "+" icon next to changes to move your changes into the staged changes folder. Then, click the "commit" button (arrow 2nd from left) to commit your changes. Finally, press push to push the files out to other collaborators.
5. Notifications will appear in the top right, confirming if pushes and pulls were successful.
IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Before pushing, always pull beforehand. Obsidian Git requires you to have the most updated form of the document before pulling.
- Do NOT work on the same exact note document at the same time as another collaborator. It is possible to work in the same file, but typing on the same document as another person will cause "contradictions" in the files, and glitch out the obsidian document. Communicate with collaborators effectively.

## Organization and Formatting
- Just reference how other files are formatted and format similarly. Headings are added by using a hashtag (#) followed by a space, then whatever you want to add afterwards. Adding a double hashtag (##) inside of an already existing heading will add a subheading, and a triple hashtag in a double hashtag has the same affect.
- Files are required to have a 2 digit tag in front of the file name in order for Obsidian to organize the files in the corresponding order. 
- Organization varies from course to course, discuss how the notes, example problems, and content is organized within the course, and work correspondingly.

## Required Features and Plugins
Community plug-ins are what makes obsidian so powerful. Plug-ins are essentially modifications to the obsidian, which allow for more aesthetic, compact, and efficient notes.
To download community plug-ins, follow the steps below.
1. First, click on the "settings" icon on the bottom left, (next to the name of the obsidian vault).
2. Navigate to the "Community plugins" tab, and click on "browse."
3. In the search bar, search for one of the following plugins listed below, and click on the window.
4. Click on “install,” and “enable.” Once the plugins are downloaded, you will be able to see the list of installed plugins after clicking the x in the top right.
5. It is extremely important that ALL of the plugins below are downloaded. If someone else makes a change involving one of the following plugins, you won’t be able to see what changes they have made, or the changes will be distorted. Below is the list of ALL REQUIRED (will be updated) plugins for maximum productivity in the Obsidian, and what they do.
------------
- Obsidian Git (If you are reading this you most likely already have it working)
- Excalidraw: Allows you to add hand written notes on native Obsidian
- Omnisearch: Allows you to search for PDFs and any other external files that are uploaded to you vault 
- Smart Typography: Allows for quicker typing of unconventional characters
- Advanced Tables: Adds Hot Keys for tabling data
- File Order: Allows you to change the order of your files using number indexing
- Better MathJax: Math autocompletion and customizable snippets
- Paste URL into selection: Allows you to paste links onto text
- DataFileEditor: Allows you to upload .HTML , .txt, etc.

## Typing Equations
Typing equations is an important skill, especially for a math/physics orientated course. To type in the equations, the “Better MathJax” Community plugin is essential for typing in special characters. To type in equations, follow the steps below.
1. Write down 4 dollar signs. In the middle of the dollar signs is where your equation will go. You will know if it worked if the dollar signs change.
2. Begin typing the equation between the 4 dollar signs, and what will be displayed after you click out of the equation is displayed below.
3. To type special characters, write a backslash (\) and the name of the character you want to type. Due to the limitless math symbols, some symbols are named differently that what you may expect, but MathJax allows for recommendations to appear. Using search engines such as Google or ChatGpt for a list of MathJax symbols is recommended. 
4. To stop typing the equation, click outside of the script, and it should be hidden while the equation is displayed.
5. Remember trial and error, learning to type equations is one of the more difficult things, but once it is learned, it isn't forgotten.
