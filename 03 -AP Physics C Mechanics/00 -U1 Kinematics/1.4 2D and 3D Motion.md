# Definitions and Concepts
- In order to work in 2 and 3 dimensions, the same concepts apply, but the difference is the management of variables along the respective axes.
- Components is the breaking of given vectors into parts that are parallel to the x and y axes respectively. 
- Projectile Motion is the most common example of 2 dimensional motion, where an object follows a parabolic path, with x axis motion and y axis motion.
- The trajectory the object follows is parabolic, and the "range" of path is the horizontal distance a projectile travels from its launch point to the SAME VERTICAL HEIGHT.
# Components
- In order to break vectors into components, recall SohCahToa, where O is opposite, H is hypothenuse, and A is adjacent
$$\sin(\theta)=O/H\rightarrow H\sin(\theta)=O$$
$$\cos(\theta)=A/H\rightarrow H\cos(\theta)=A$$
