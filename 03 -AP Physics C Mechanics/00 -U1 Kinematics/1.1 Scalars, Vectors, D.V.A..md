- ==Vector Quantities== and ==Scalar Quantities== are the 2 types of quantities that define all properties of Physics.
- ==Magnitude== represents the amount or size of a quantity, for example
  If you have 5 eggs, 5 is the magnitude of the quantity of eggs. 
- ==Direction== specifies in which way a value "points." In the traditional coordinate plane , -5 along the X-axis would represent 5 units to the left.
- Scalar Quantities represent magnitude, but no direction. Includes quantities such as Mass, Energy, Temperature, Time, etc.
- Vector Quantities represent magnitude and direction. Direction is occasionally be denoted with angle, θ, with respect to the X-axis. Includes quantities such as Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration.
# Vector Representation
- Vectors can be denoted in 2 ways, using Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z,) and Polar coordinates (r, θ).
- ==Component Notation==, where {a,b,c} are constants and unit vectors {i,j,k} represent the {x,y,z} axes respectively. These unit vectors have a value of 1 and can be ignored in calculations.
$$
r=a\hat i + b\hat j + c\hat k
$$
- Breaking Vectors into components through trigonometry is way to align the various components of the vectors with each respective axis.
- Multiplying the whole (original) vector by the sin or cos of the angle with respect to the X-axis, its possible to derive the magnitude of the vector's components in the X and Y directions.
$$F_x=Fcos(\theta)$$$$F_y=Fsin(\theta)$$
- To find a vector from it's components, use Pythagorean theorem.
$$
|r|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}
$$
- The absolute value of a vector disregards direction, turning it into a scalar quantity of its magnitude. 
## Vector Addition and Subtraction
- Vectors can be added and subtracted geometrically (tip to tail) and algebraically (component form vector addition). A key property of vectors is addition and subtraction is ==communitive==.
- Tip to Tail: Vector addition and subtraction geometrically. Recall that vectors can be represented with with an arrow, with length representing the magnitude, and the "tip" of the arrow representing direction. Vectors can be grafted on top of one another, connecting the "tail" of the 2nd vector to the tip of the first one. The resulting vector (commonly denoted as Vector R) is drawn from the tail of the 1st vector, to the tip of the 2nd one. See visual below.![[Pasted image 20250227193702.png]]
- To subtract vectors geometrically, understand that,$$\vec{a}-\vec{b}=\vec{a}+(-\vec{b})$$
- When a vector is negative as denoted above, then the magnitude remains the same, but the direction is flipped. In turn, subtracting vectors uses the same tip to tail method, but flipping the direction of the 2nd vector, and following the same process. See visual below.![[Pasted image 20250227194636.png]]
- Vectors can also be multiplied by scalar quantities, such as whole numbers and fractions that are NOT VECTORS. This simply changes the magnitude of the vectors, and direction is only affected if a negative value is present.

- The other method of adding and subtracting vectors is through Component notation. Recall that vectors can be broken into components in 3 dimensions. When adding/subtracting 2 vectors, combine each components separately, $$\vec{a}+\vec{b}=(a_x+b_x)i+(a_y+b_y)j+(a_z+b_z)k$$$$\vec{a}-\vec{b}=(a_x-b_x)i+(a_y+b_y)j+(a_z+b_z)k$$
 ## Vector Multiplication
- In order to multiply a vector by another vector, Dot Product and Cross Product must be applied.
- ==Dot Product==: Also known as Scalar Product, measures how parallel 2 vectors are. Unlike Cross Product, Dot Product will ALWAYS yield a scalar quantity. The scalar product from the dot product represents how parallel the 2 vectors are in a coordinate plane, meaning the more parallel the vectors are, the greater the magnitude of the scalar. If the 2 vectors are perpendicular, then the product will always equal zero. $$\vec{a}•\vec{b}=(a_1b_1)+(a_2b_2)+(a_3b_3)$$
- Note that there are no {i,j,k} denotations of direction, meaning that after multiplying all numbers, add them all together to get a scalar value. 
- Also note that Dot Product is communitive and distributive. (C is a scalar) $$\vec{a}•\vec{b}=\vec{b}•\vec{a}$$$$
c(\vec{a})•\vec{b}=c(\vec{a}•\vec{b})=\vec{a}•c(\vec{b})
$$
$$\vec{a}•\vec{a}=|a|^2$$
$$\vec{a}•0=0$$
- Dot product's main application is with the equation below
$$\vec{a}•\vec{b}=|a||b|cos(\theta)$$
- When isolating theta, dot product allows for a simpler calculation of the angle between 2 vectors.$$\theta=cos^{-1}(\frac{\vec{a}•\vec{b}}{|a||b|})$$
- The problem below is a summary of the mathematical concepts of Dot Product. ![[Pasted image 20250227204516.png]]
