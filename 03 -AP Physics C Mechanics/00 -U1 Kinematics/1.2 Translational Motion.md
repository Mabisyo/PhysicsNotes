# S.I. Units Disclaimer
- The International System of Units, is the international standard of measurement. They regulate measurements by making sure the units are consistent throughout calculations, and are able to be understood by everyone universally.
- Consequently, the list includes the most common used symbols for each quantity, and the units of measurement for each quantity. ==All calculations must be done in the corresponding SI units.== Unit Conversion isn't included in this course, but it is possible to do every unit conversion in the [Ti-84 Calculators](https://youtu.be/o7G1t_S0LYc?si=DBb1h2umJyW25CTO). The SI units will be denoted for each quantity throughout the course.
- Keep in mind that some questions will present data in different units, and ask for the answer in different units. Convert the data into the correct SI units, preform the calculations, and convert the data back to the requested units.

# Definitions and Concepts
- Translational Motion refers to motion in a straight line, or in a single direction, rather than rotationally.
- Kinematics is a study of motion, which disregards forces and focuses strictly on the motion of objects, rather than what causes them.
- Time is the instant when something happens. A time interval is the time between two "t" values. Time is a scalar, and it's SI units are seconds (s), and represented as t.
- Position is where an object is located, usually denoted in a coordinate grid with a point of reference at the origin. Considered a Vector, represented as x or y. 
- Displacement is a change in 2 positions, calculated by subtracting the final position by the initial position. Displacement is always the shortest path between 2 points. It is a vector quantity, and represented as delta x.
- Distance refers to the total length of the path the object takes to its final position. It is a scalar quantity, and referred to as d.![](distanceVdisplacement.webp)
- The SI units for distance, displacement, and position is meters (m). 
- Velocity is the change in position with respect to time, or displacement with respect to time. It is a vector quantity, with SI units meters per second (m/s).
- Speed is just velocity, but with direction ignored, making it a scalar quantity with the same SI units as velocity.
- Acceleration is the change in velocity with respect to time. It represents how much the speed is increasing or decreasing over a certain period. It is a vector quantity with SI units in meters per second squared (m/s^2).
- A change in acceleration is a called a jolt or jerk, but that is not covered in this course.
- Subscripts f and i represent final and initial values, but different subscripts such as o for original value may be used.
## Average Vs Instantaneous Values
- It is important to denote the difference in average quantities vs instantaneous quantities due to their differences in contextual meaning and magnitude.
- Average quantities represent the slope of the secant line intersecting 2 separate data points, (in this case 2 time values).
- Instantaneous quantities represent the slope of a tangent line intersecting a single data point. This is the definition of a derivative. 
- When being asked to find average quantities or instantaneous quantities at certain points, its important to differentiate between a derivative and a slope.
- Note that if a function is linear, the average and instantaneous quantities are the same.
# Mathematical Application
- When graphing position vs time (PvT), velocity vs time (VvT), and acceleration vs time (AvT), the quantities are relatable through calculus. 
- The slope of the PvT graph represents velocity, and the slope of the VvT function represents acceleration.
- Additionally, the area underneath the curve of an AvT graph represents velocity, and the area underneath the curve of an VvT graph results in the displacement.
- Without using calculus, it is impossible to go from a full graph to another, but with calculus, exact velocity and acceleration values can be found, and represented graphically. With derivatives and integrals, it is possible to fully switch between graphs, as such.
$$x(t)\rightarrow\frac{d}{dt}\rightarrow v(t) \rightarrow \frac{d}{dt} \rightarrow a(t)$$
$$a(t) \rightarrow \intop_{t_1}^{t_2}dt \rightarrow v(t) \rightarrow  \intop_{t_1}^{t_2}dt \rightarrow a(t)$$
- Without calculus, it is also impossible to work with a changing acceleration.
- If a v(t)=0, then the object isn't moving. If v(t)>0, the object is moving in the positive direction (right, up, north, east). It v(t)<0, the object is moving in the negative direction (left, down, south, west).
- An object changes direction direction when v(t)=0 during motion, (critical point).
- If a(t) and v(t) have the same sign, signifying that they are pointing in the same direction, then the object speeds up.
- Conversely, a(t) and v(t) have different signs, the object will slow down.
- To find the furthest position or maximum velocity an object travels at, you take the derivative of the respective functions, and find their critical points by setting them equal to zero.
- If acceleration is zero throughout the entire motion, average velocity values will give the instantaneous velocity for every t value.
# Kinematic Equations
- The kinematic equations are equations specifically designed for solving for a missing quantity.
- ==These equations are only applicable if acceleration is CONSTANT.==
- Keep in mind there are 5 quantities, each equation has 4, and you always need 3.
- 3 of the equations are given to you on test day on your equation sheet (signified by boxes), and the other 2 are derivable, and worth typing into the calculator.
$$\boxed{\vec{v_f}=\vec{v_i}+\vec{a}*t}$$
$$\boxed{\vec{x_f}=\vec{x_i}+\vec{v_i}*t+\frac{1}{2}\vec{a}*t^2}$$
$$\boxed{\vec{v_f}^2=\vec{v_i}^2+2\vec{a}*\Delta\vec{x}}$$
$$\Delta\vec{x}=\vec{v_i}*t+\frac{1}{2}\vec{a}*t$$
$$\Delta\vec{x}=\frac{\vec{v_f}-\vec{v_i}}{2}*t$$
- Note that subtracting initial position over to the final position in equation 2, final position minus initial position is equal to displacement, or equation 4.
# Frames of Reference
- In a coordinate plane, the origin, point (0,0), represents the center of the coordinate grid, and all other points in the grid are in reference to point (0,0).
- For example, the point (3,4) is 3 units to the right, and 4 units upward from point (0,0). However, say theoretically, the origin was point (2,2), which would make the point (3,4) 1 unit to the right, and 2 units upward. This would change the displacement of (3,4) from the new origin, (2,2), and change the calculations in the context of the problem.
- Therefore, it is very important to decide where the origin in the problem is, and how to derive certain quantities from other quantities given from different points of reference. 
- To add 2 vectors along the SAME axis (2d and 3d are in 1.4), make sure the middle two terms are the same and cancel, and the outer 2 terms make up the final term. See example below.
Say Car 1, moves at a constant velocity of to the left, and Car 2 drives towards the right, past it, at a velocity of ***x m/s***. Car 2 is driving towards Car 3, which is parked in the middle of the road. What is the velocity of Car 1 with respect to Car 3?
- V sub 12 is velocity of Car 1 to Car 2, V sub 23 is velocity of Car 2 to Car 3, and we are trying to find V sub 13, which is velocity of Car 1 to Car 3.
$$\vec{v}_{13}=\vec{v}_{12}+\vec{v}_{23}$$
- The 2 middle 2's cancel, and the 1 and 3 come together to form the 3rd vector.

# Free Fall Motion
- Free fall motion refers motion where objects are not affected by air resistance, meaning they fall with a constant acceleration "g." These questions are common the ap exam.
- "g," commonly referred to as little g, is the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of Earth. It is equal to 9.8 meters per second squared, or 10 meters per second squared. On the AP exam, there are answer keys for both, so working with whichever one is more comfortable is recommended.
- In freefall motion, "g" is always present, so in the kinematic equations, wherever acceleration is present, plug in NEGATIVE 9.8m/s^2 (due to gravity accelerating objects downward). 
Some quick tips and conceptual to make solving these problems as quickly as possible.
- Whenever the term free fall is used, little g is always the acceleration
- If an object is "dropped," then the initial velocity is zero.
- If an object is thrown upward, then at the top of it's parabolic path, the object has a velocity of zero.
- If an object is at a certain height "h" on its way up with a certain velocity "v" on its way up, then on it's way down, the object at the same height "h" will have "-v" (equal in magnitude but opposite in direction) on the way down. In turn, when solving for t when using equation 3 (above), you will get 2 t values using the quadratic formula. The first t value will be the velocity on the way up, and the 2nd t value will be the velocity on the way down.
