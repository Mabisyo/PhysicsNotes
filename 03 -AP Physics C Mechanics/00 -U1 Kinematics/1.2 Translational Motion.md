# S.I. Units Disclaimer
- The International System of Units, is the international standard of measurement. They regulate measurements by making sure the units are consistent throughout calculations, and are able to be understood by everyone universally.
- Consequently, the list includes the most common used symbols for each quantity, and the units of measurement for each quantity. ==All calculations must be done in the corresponding SI units.== Unit Conversion isn't included in this course, but it is possible to do every unit conversion in the [Ti-84 Calculators](https://youtu.be/o7G1t_S0LYc?si=DBb1h2umJyW25CTO). The SI units will be denoted for each quantity throughout the course.
- Keep in mind that some questions will present data in different units, and ask for the answer in different units. Convert the data into the correct SI units, preform the calculations, and convert the data back to the requested units.

# Definitions and Concepts
- Translational Motion refers to motion in a straight line, or in a single direction, rather than rotationally.
- Kinematics is a study of motion, which disregards forces and focuses strictly on the motion of objects, rather than what causes them.
- Time is the instant when something happens. A time interval is the time between two "t" values. Time is a scalar, and it's SI units are seconds (s).
- Position is where an object is located, usually denoted in a coordinate grid with a point of reference at the origin. Considered a Vector.
- Displacement is a change in 2 positions, calculated by subtracting the final position by the initial position. Displacement is always the shortest path between 2 points. It is a vector quantity.
- Distance refers to the total length of the path the object takes to its final position. It is a scalar quantity.![](distanceVdisplacement.webp)
- The SI units for distance, displacement, and position is meters (m). 
- Velocity is the change in position with respect to time, or displacement with respect to time. It is a vector quantity, with SI units meters per second (m/s).
- Speed is just velocity, but with direction ignored, making it a scalar quantity with the same SI units as velocity.
- Acceleration is the change in velocity with respect to time. It represents how much the speed is increasing or decreasing over a certain period. It is a vector quantity with SI units in meters per second squared (m/s^2).
- A change in acceleration is a called a jolt or jerk, but that is not covered in this course.
## Average Vs Instantaneous Quantities
- It is important to denote the difference in average quantities vs instantaneous quantities due to their differences in contextual meaning and magnitude.
- Average quantities represent the slope of the secant line intersecting 2 separate data points, (in this case 2 time values).
- Instantaneous quantities represent the slope of a tangent line intersecting a single data point. This is the definition of a derivative. 
- When being asked to find average quantities or instantaneous quantities at certain points, its important to differentiate between a derivative and a slope.
- Note that if a function is linear, the average and instantaneous quantities are the same.
# Mathematical Application
- When graphing position vs time (PvT), velocity vs time (VvT), and acceleration vs time (AvT), the quantities are relatable through calculus. 
- The slope of the PvT graph represents velocity, and the slope of the VvT function represents acceleration.
- Additionally, the area underneath the curve of an AvT graph represents velocity, and the area underneath the curve of an VvT graph results in the displacement.
- Without using calculus, it is impossible to go from a full graph to another, but with calculus, exact velocity and acceleration values can be found, and represented graphically. With derivatives and integrals, it is possible to fully switch between graphs, as such.
$$x(t)\rightarrow\frac{d}{dt}\rightarrow v(t) \rightarrow \frac{d}{dt} \rightarrow a(t)$$
$$a(t) \rightarrow \intop_{t_1}^{t_2}dt \rightarrow v(t) \rightarrow  \intop_{t_1}^{t_2}dt \rightarrow a(t)$$
# Kinematic Equations
- The kinematic equations are equations specifically designed for solving for a missing quantity.
- ==These equations are only applicable if acceleration is CONSTANT.==
- Keep in mind there are 5 quantities, each equation has 4, and you always need 3.
