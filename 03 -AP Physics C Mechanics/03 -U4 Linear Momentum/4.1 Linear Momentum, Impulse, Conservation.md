## Linear Momentum
- ==Linear Momentum== is a vector quantity denoted by p.
- The formula for Linear Momentum is: $$p=mv$$
- Newtonâ€™s Second Law states that: $$F=ma$$ which we can manipulate to get: $$F = m(\frac{dv}{dt})$$ then using this we can multiply and substitute variables to result in the instantaneous expression: $$F = \frac{dp}{dt}$$
- Finding the average of this force we find that: $$\bar F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$
## Impulse
- ==Impulse== is a vector quantity denotated by J. It is the product of force and the time during which it acts.
- One formula for Impulse is: $$J = \bar F \Delta t$$ but this can also be expressed by: $$J = \Delta p$$
- Sometimes referred to as the Impulse-Momentum Theorem, if the force varies over an interval of time then it can also be expressed as an integral: $$J = \intop_{t_1}^{t_2} F(t) dt$$ however on the equation sheet for the FRQ section it will be represented as: $$\boxed{J = \intop Fdt = p}$$
## Conservation of Linear Momentum
- Two interacting objects experience equal but opposite momentum changes (assuming there are no external forces). This implies that the total linear momentum of the system remains constant because both objects undergo equal but opposite momentum changes.
- The previous argument can apply to any number of objects so long as the only forces they feel are from each other. This means that ==in an isolated system, the total linear momentum will remain constant.== 
- The ==**Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum**== in equation form (for two object colliding) is: $$m_1 \vec v_{1i}+ m_2 \vec v_{2i} = m_1 \vec v_{1f} + m_2 \vec v_{2f}$$
