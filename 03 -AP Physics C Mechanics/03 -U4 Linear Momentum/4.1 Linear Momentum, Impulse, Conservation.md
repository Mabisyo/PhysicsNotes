### Linear Momentum
- ==Linear Momentum== is a vector quantity denoted by p.
- The formula for Linear Momentum is: $$\color {orange}p=mv$$
- Newtonâ€™s Second Law states that: $$F=ma$$ which we can manipulate to get: $$F = m(\frac{dv}{dt})$$ then using this we can multiply and substitute variables to result in the instantaneous expression: $$\color {orange}F = \frac{dp}{dt}$$
- Finding the average of this force we find that: $$\color {orange} \bar F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$$
