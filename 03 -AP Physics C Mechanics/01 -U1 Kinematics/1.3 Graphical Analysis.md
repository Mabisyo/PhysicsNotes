# Expectations
- This course requires you to derive meaning from graphs, and analyze relationships between variables, such as proportional relationships and meaning of area under graphs and functions. Linearization is a very important skill required for the course.

# Core Conceptual
- Remember, the manipulated variable is graphed along the X axis, meaning in a velocity vs, time graph, time is the manipulated variable.
Below is a velocity vs time graph with relationships with acceleration labeled. ![](VvTGraphConcept.webp)
- The distance the velocity coordinate is from the t-axis represents the magnitude of the velocity at that t value.
- The direction of the velocity is represented by the t-axis. If the v(t) graph is above the graph, then the velocity is positive, if it is below the t-axis then it is negative.
- If the velocity line is linear, then acceleration is constant, from b to c, and from f to d.
- If the graph is horizontal, then there is no acceleration, from d to e.
- If the velocity line is non-linear, acceleration is changing, from a to b, from c to d, from e to f, and from g to h.
- Note that as the graph travels away from the t-axis, then acceleration is increasing, but if the graph is approaching the t-axis, the object is acceleration is decreasing.
- Note that if this graph was reflected over the t-axis, all descriptions of acceleration would remain the same, but it would be in the negative direction.
- Displacement is the area underneath the curve between any 2 t-values. It does NOT represent the displacement. 
- It is not possible to find the value of the displacement of a velocity vs time graph with a changing acceleration without a higher level of calculus. It is only possible if the equation of the v(t) graph is given.
- If acceleration is constant however, it is possible to find displacement with basic geometry, finding the area of certain shapes underneath a curve. 
- These relationships are constant through out translational motion, but different variables have different relationships. 
# Proportional Relationships and Linearization
![](proportionalRealtionships.png)
- Above are the 5 relationships between variables that are essential for the AP exam.
- You need to be able to identify which of the 5 relationships shown above is the relationships between 2 variables, and explain it exactly how the table describes the relationship. 
- Note that y=-m(x)+b is the same as the 2nd relationship, and the explanation would be "as x increases, y *decreases* directly proportionally."
- Linearization is the process of manipulating the output variable to make a graph linear, in order to analyze the slope.
For example, say the relationship between b and a is...
$$a=mb^2$$
To linearize the graph, you would apply the same square to a,
$$a^2=mb^2$$
This allows you to analyze the slope "m" in the function, and determine how a and b are proportional.
