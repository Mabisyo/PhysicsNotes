# Definitions and Concepts
- In order to work in 2 and 3 dimensions, the same concepts apply, but the difference is the management of variables along the respective axes.
- Components is the breaking of given vectors into parts that are parallel to the x and y axes respectively. 
- Projectile Motion is the most common example of 2 dimensional motion, where an object follows a parabolic path, with x axis motion and y axis motion.
- The trajectory the object follows is parabolic, and the "range" of path is the horizontal distance a projectile travels from its launch point to the SAME VERTICAL HEIGHT.
# Components
- In order to break vectors into components, recall SohCahToa, where O is opposite side, H is hypothenuse, and A is adjacent side...
$$\sin(\theta)=\frac{O}{H}\rightarrow H\sin(\theta)=O$$
$$\cos(\theta)=\frac{A}{H}\rightarrow H\cos(\theta)=A$$
$$\tan(\theta)=\frac{O}{A}\rightarrow A\tan(\theta)=O\rightarrow\frac{O}{\tan(\theta)}=A$$
- To break a vector into its components, you need to solve for the corresponding sides using trigonometry. ![](componentsofvectors.png)
- Note that sine solves for the opposite side of the angle, being the perpendicular component parallel to the y axis, and cosine solves for the adjacent side, the parallel component that is parallel to the x-axis. . If the angle given was at the top of the triangle, sine and cosine would swap, and solve for the opposite components of the vector.
- Tangent allows you to solve for the opposite component if you only have the x or y component of a vector.
- To get an original vector from its components, use Pythagorean theorem to solve for the hypothenuse.
# Projectile Motion
- Projectile motion is the most common example of 2d motion. It consists of unaccelerated motion along the x-axis, and constant accelerated motion along the y-axis (free fall). Solving these problems consists of breaking motion into 2 components, solving for motion along the x and y axes respectfully.
- There 2 main instances, and due to the predictable patterns of projectile motion, equations are derivable.
- Objects are normally thrown either from an elevated height (y-position>0), or from a ground level (y-position=0).
## Instance 1
- The object is launched horizontally, (0 degrees with respect to x) and accelerates downward, while moving constantly forward.
- The range of this motion is 0.
- There is no initial y velocity component, meaning the object accelerates from 0 with a magnitude of "g."
## Instance 2
- The object is launched with an angle with respect to the horizontal. The if the angle is between 0 and 90 degrees, the object is launched forward.
- If the launch angle is 90 degrees, it is launched straight upwards, in free fall.
- If the launch angle is greater than 90 degrees, it is launched backwards (not important).
- The range will equal the distance the object takes to return to the same height. Example: if the object is thrown an angle from a-top a cliff 50m high, and falls and lands on the ground below, the range will be from its initial launch upwards to the position of the object on the way back down at y-position=50.
# Derived Projectile Motion Equations
- Each equation is derived from the previous kinematic equations, and allow you to solve from different variables quicker. These equations are worth typing into your calculator.
- It is important to choose a frame of reference. If the initial y position is on a cliff 50m high, then the origin, or (0,0) would be at the bottom of the cliff, and the object would begin at a position of (0,50).
## Position for any T-value
$$x=v_{ix}*t$$ $$y=v_{iy}*t+\frac{-g}{2}*t^2$$
- Notice that the x axis isn't accelerating, so the position at any t value is just multiplied by the velocity.
- The y positions are accelerating however, so accounting for acceleration (note that g is negative, making it -9.8m/s^2) is important.
## Velocity for any T-Value
$$v_x(t)=v_i\cos(\theta)$$
$$v_y(t)=v_i\sin(\theta)+(-g)*t$$
- The total velocity at any t value for the x component is constant because there is no horizontal acceleration
- The total velocity at any t value for the y component is accelerating, meaning you have to multiply negative g (due to direction) by t.
## Time of Flight (Total Air Time) 
$$t_{flight}=\frac{2v_{i}\sin(\theta)}{g}$$
- This equation only solves for the time of flight of the RANGE. Meaning, if a projectile is launched from a height, then this equation solves for the time it takes to return to the same height. In order to solve for the total time for an instance like this, you can use the t-flight equation, and then solve the time it takes for the object to fall to the ground from that t-value.
- Note that this equation uses the original velocity vector, not the component of any vector
- Also notice that as the angle increases to 90, the total air time increases because sine is increasing on the interval (0,90). In simpler terms, the more vertically the object is thrown, the longer it is in the air for.
## Maximum Height
$$h_{max}=\frac{v^2_{i}\sin^2{(\theta)}}{2g}+y_{i}$$
- This equation solves for the maximum height of a projectile.
- Note that if the object is thrown horizontally, the angle is 0 degrees, which makes sine zero, making the whole fraction zero, making the initial y position the max height.
- As stated before, the greater the angle from the horizontal, the higher the maximum height, due to sine increasing on the interval (0,90).
## Range (Horizontal Distance)
$$R=\frac{v^2_i\sin(2\theta)}{g}$$
- This equation solves for the horizontal distance the object takes to return to the same height.
- Note that if the object is thrown at a horizontal, then the angle =0, making range equal to zero.
- If you want to find the total x displacement of a projectile launched from a height to the point it reaches the ground, add the range to the access displacement covered after the projectile reaches the height of launch.
## Equation of Trajectory
$$y(x)=x\tan(\theta)-\frac{gx^2}{2v^2_i\cos^2(\theta)}$$
- The trajectory equation graphs the parabolic path of a projectile in a coordinate grid.
- Recall that in position vs time graphs, time is graphed on the x-axis, and position is graphed along the y-axis. This means motion is represented as a function of time.
- In the trajectory equation, the y position is given as a function of x, meaning as you plug in the y position, it will give you the function of time.

# 3D motion disclaimer
- Unit 1 rarely works with 3D motion. But 3D motion is worked with in Unit 5 with Torque and Cross Product.
