- ==Vector Quantities== and ==Scalar Quantities== are the 2 types of quantities that define all properties of Physics.
- ==Magnitude== represents the amount or size of a quantity, for example
  If you have 5 eggs, 5 is the magnitude of the quantity of eggs. 
- ==Direction== specifies in which way a value "points." In the traditional coordinate plane , -5 along the X-axis would represent 5 units to the left.
- Scalar Quantities represent magnitude, but no direction. Includes quantities such as Mass, Energy, Temperature, Time, etc.
- Vector Quantities represent magnitude and direction. Direction is occasionally be denoted with angle, Î¸, with respect to the X-axis. Includes quantities such as Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration.
