The TI-84 calculators are very powerful tools, and allow you to upload notes onto the calculator to have on exam day. Even though it may seem like cheating, it is recommended by many teachers and by college board themselves, due to the sheer magnitude of the equations in the course. Follow the steps below to upload the provided notes below.

Materials needed: 
- TI-84 Plus CE (not sure if other models work)
- A computer that is able to download files
- The TI-84 charging cable to plug into the desktop

# Step 1: Jailbreaking the calculator
Jailbreaking the calculator prevents the TI-84’s software from interfering with any downloaded apps or notes to the calculator. If the calculator isn’t jailbroken, it is a lot more difficult to upload notes. If your calculator is already jailbroken, skip this step. To jailbreak the calculator, either follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t0H2nl75TA), or the steps below.
1. Download the TI-Connect CE app and ensure that your calculator is plugged in.
2. There is a document button on the CONNECT app, make sure you’re on that screen. Now go to this [website](https://calcplex.com/ti84plusce-jailbreak-tutorial/) and download the Jailbreak and Cabrijr onto your computer.
3. Once you have these files on your computer, drag and drop both the files onto the screen you are on in the CONNECT app. 
4. Now, turn off and on your calculator to “reset it”. You should be able to click apps and see CabriJr. Click on the CabriJr app after it appears and press any key to continue. Then, a drop down menu should pop up (if it doesn’t press the “y=” key.) Finally, select open and select ARTIFICE.
5. In the “arTIfiCE SHELL” screen, click on the option called CALCPLEX by pressing enter. The screen will refresh and then say “No ASM programs found”. Exit by pressing the “mode” key. THE JAILBREAK IS NOW INSTALLED.

# Step 2: Downloading the tFiles app on the calculator
The tFiles app is the app downloaded onto the calculator responsible for organizing notes. To download the tFiles app, either follow [this video](https://youtu.be/C-6Qqudk4js?si=l0pGMgFEezlh3PZY), or the steps below.
1. Go to this [link](https://www.ti84calcwiz.com/how-to-put-notes-on-the-ti-84-plus-ce/) and look for the “What you’ll need” section. Download the files that says Notes CE program. BEWARE this is a zip file so you will need to right click it in file explorer and extract it.
2. Once the file is extracted, drag both the “Notes” and “TFILES” files onto the CONNECT app the same way you did when you were jailbreaking it. 
3. Now you turn off and on your calculator and you should have the apps installed. However, if you wish to install notes immediately, keep your calculator plugged in.
After this process, you should have the “ConvText” on your desktop. This is important to upload the notes.

# Step 3: Uploading Notes
After following the tutorials, the “ConvText” application should be present on the desktop. To add your own notes to the calculator, do the following…
1. Create a notepad on your computer and type in the desired notes
2. Save the notepad file to your desktop.
3. Then, drag and drop that notepad file on top of the “ConvText” application, which will turn it into a file compatible with the tFiles application on the calculator.
4. Next, plug in your calculator into the charging cord and connect it to the desktop.
5. Open the TI-Connect App, navigate to the files icon (underneath the camera icon on left side), and drag and drop the converted text file with the notes into right hand side of the screen.
6. A pop up menu should appear, click “all selected devices”, and make sure the checkmark is checked off.
7. After entering, the notes will now be in the calculator.
8. To access each note once it has been sent as a “.8xp” file after you converted it and sent it to your calculator, just click (apps → CalcPlex → Tfiles → insertname”.txt”) and the notes should be there.

# Unit Notes and How to Access Them
1. For each of the files below click on them to see the text, and on the top right you can click the three vertical dots and click “open in default app”. 
2. Doing so will open a notepad, which following the steps above, will allow you to save and open the notes on the calculator.
Below are the list of notes for each unit for the course. Keep in mind that these notes are majority equations, and the occasional one or two easily forgettable details. The expectation is that you understand the course concepts and have them memorized on exam day.
