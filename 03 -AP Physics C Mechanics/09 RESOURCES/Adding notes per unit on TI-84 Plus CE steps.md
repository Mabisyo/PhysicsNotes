Materials needed: 
-TI-Connect Ce app on computer
-TI 84 Plus CE calculator (not sure if other forms accepted)
-Calculator charging cable to connect to computer

### Jailbreaking the calculator:
## Step One
-Download the TI-Connect CE app and ensure that your calculator is plugged in.

## Step Two
-There is a document button on the CONNECT app, make sure you’re on that screen. Now go to this [website](https://calcplex.com/ti84plusce-jailbreak-tutorial/) and download the Jailbreak and Cabrijr onto your computer.

## Step Three
-Once you have these files on your computer, drag and drop both the files onto the screen you are on in the CONNECT app. 

## Step Four
- Now, turn off and on your calculator to “reset it”. You should be able to click apps and see CabriJr. Click on the CabriJr app after it appears and press any key to continue. Then, a drop down menu should pop up (if it doesn’t press the “y=” key.) Finally, select open and select ARTIFICE.

## Step Five
- In the “arTIfiCE SHELL” screen, click on the option called CALCPLEX by pressing enter. The screen will refresh and then say “No ASM programs found”. Exit by pressing the “mode” key. THE JAILBREAK IS NOW INSTALLED.


## Downloading the tFiles app on the calculator

## Step one
- Go to this [link](https://www.ti84calcwiz.com/how-to-put-notes-on-the-ti-84-plus-ce/) and look for the “What you’ll need” section. Download the files that says Notes CE program. BEWARE this is a zip file so you will need to right click it in file explorer and extract it.

## Step two
- Once the file is extracted, drag both the “Notes” and “TFILES” files onto the CONNECT app the same way you did when you were jailbreaking it. 

## Step three
- Now you turn off and on your calculator and you should have the apps installed. However, if you wish to install notes immediately, keep your calculator plugged in.
