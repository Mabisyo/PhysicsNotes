# Linear Momentum
## Definitions and Concepts
- ==Linear Momentum== is the description of an object’s linear movement and how it interacts with other objects based on its mass and velocity. ==Linear momentum is a vector quantity== denoted by the Greek letter rho, ρ.
- Newton first expressed his Second Law by stating “*The alteration of motion is…proportional to the…force impressed…*” meaning ==Δρ α F==, but a larger force that acts for a short period of time can produce the same Δρ as a small force acting for a longer period of time.
## Formulas
- The formula for Linear Momentum that will be shown on the reference sheet is: $$\boxed{\vec \rho = m \vec v}$$
- We can turn the proportion ==Δρ α F== into an equation by taking the average force that acts over a time interval: $$ \overline F = \frac{\Delta \rho}{\Delta t}$$ 
- Taking the limit as t approaches 0 we find the instantaneous force to be: $$\boxed {F_{net} = \frac{d\vec \rho}{dt}}$$
# Impulse
## Definitions and Concepts
- ==Impulse== is the product of a force and the time for which it acts on something. Impulse is also a vector quantity denotated by J.
## Formulas
- One formula for Impulse is: $$J = \overline F \Delta t$$ but this can also be expressed by: $$J = \Delta p$$
- Sometimes referred to as the Impulse-Momentum Theorem, if the force isn’t constant and varies over an interval of time then it can also be expressed as an integral: $$J = \intop_{t_1}^{t_2} F(t) dt$$ however on the equation sheet for the FRQ section it will be represented as: $$\boxed{J = \intop Fdt = \Delta p}$$
