# Definitions and Concepts
## ==Elastic Collisions:==
- **==Kinetic Energy (K) is conserved.==** (If the collision is elastic know that linear momentum is conserved, but also kinetic energy is conserved). Ordinary macroscopic collisions are never truly elastic because there is always a change in energy due to energy transferred as heat, deformation, and sound. However, if the two objects do not deform much or at all (marbles/billiard balls) then the change in energy is small enough to be ignored.
## ==Inelastic Collisions:==
- The resulting Kinetic Energy after the collisions is different that its initial value. An extreme case of objects being perfectly inelastic are when the object stick together after the collision, these objects will then move together as one.
## ==Conservation of Linear Momentum:==
- In all cases of isolated collisions (elastic or inelastic) the Conservation of Linear Momentum states that: $$p_i = p_f$$

# Additional Formulas
## Elastic Collision: 
- Since objects bounce off of each other in Elastic Collisions, the objects will have different resulting velocities and move as separate objects. The formula used to solve problems with an elastic collision is:$$m_1v_1+m_2v_2 = m_1 v_1'+m_2v_2'$$
## Inelastic Collision:
- Since objects in Inelastic Collisions stick together after collision, they will continue to move as a single object with one velocity. Resulting in the formula for inelastic collisions to be: $$m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = (m_1 + m_2)v'$$
