# Uniform Circular Motion (UCM)
## Definitions and Concepts
- An object is said to be in UCM if it is travelling at a constant speed around a circular path. ==The speed is constant but the velocity is not.==
- Centripetal Acceleration, denotated by ac, is the acceleration that changes an object’s direction, to keep it on its circular path, but not its speed. In order for there to be an acceleration there must be a force action on the object, this is the ==Centripetal Force== denoted by Fc.
- Centripetal Force always points towards the center of the circle the object is travelling along. ==The centripetal force is a NET force and does not show up on FBDs.==
#### Types of UCM Circles
- Horizontal Circles are cases where gravity can be neglected because the object is rotating on the x-axis. Think of the point on the outside edge of helicopter blades, the point moves in a circle with its motion unaffected by gravity.
- Vertical Circles are cases where gravity must be considered because the object is rotating on the y-axis. Think of a rollercoaster, the car moves in a “loop” but accelerates downward due to gravity.
 
## Formulas
- The formula for the centripetal acceleration shown on the reference sheet is: $$\boxed{a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}}$$
- Plugging this in to Newton’s 2nd Law, where Fc is the NET force, we get: $$F_c=ma_c=m\frac{v^2}{r}$$

# Gravitation and Planetary Motion
## Kepler’s Laws
- ==Kepler’s First Law:== “Every planet moves in an elliptical orbit, with the Sun at one focus.”![[kl1.jpg]]
- ==Kepler’s Second Law:== “As a planet moves in an orbit, a line drawn from the Sun to the Planet sweeps equal areas in equal time intervals.” This is a consequence of the Conservation of Angular Momentum which is discussed later.![[kl2.png]]
- ==Kepler’s Third Law:== “The orbital period of a planet squared is proportional to the planets radius (distance) from the focus point it is orbiting around.” The ratio is shown as: $$T^2=R^3 \space or \space \frac{T^2}{R^3}$$
## Newton’s Law of Gravitation
- All objects exert an attractive force on each other, called the gravitational force, whose strength is proportional to the product of the objects’ masses and inversely proportional to the square of the center-to-center distance between them. If G is the universal gravitational constant then the strength of the force is given by the equation: $$F_G=-\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}\hat r$$
- $$G=6.67\times10^-11 \frac{N\cdot m^2}{kg^2}$$
