# Uniform Circular Motion (UCM)
## Definitions and Concepts
- An object is said to be in UCM if it is travelling at a constant speed around a circular path. ==The speed is constant but the velocity is not.==
- Centripetal Acceleration, denotated by ac, is the acceleration that changes an object’s direction, to keep it on its circular path, but not its speed. In order for there to be an acceleration there must be a force action on the object, this is the ==Centripetal Force== denoted by Fc.
- Centripetal Force always points towards the center of the circle the object is travelling along. ==The centripetal force is a NET force and does not show up on FBDs.==
#### Types of UCM Circles
- Horizontal Circles are cases where gravity can be neglected because the object is rotating on the x-axis. Think of the point on the outside edge of helicopter blades, the point moves in a circle with its motion unaffected by gravity.
- Vertical Circles are cases where gravity must be considered because the object is rotating on the y-axis. Think of a rollercoaster, the car moves in a “loop” but accelerates downward due to gravity.
 
## Formulas
- The formula for the centripetal acceleration shown on the reference sheet is: $$\boxed{a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}}$$
- Plugging this in to Newton’s 2nd Law, where Fc is the NET force, we get: $$F_c=ma_c=m\frac{v^2}{r}$$

# Gravitation and Planetary Motion
## Kepler’s Laws
- ==Kepler’s First Law:== “Every planet moves in an elliptical orbit, with the Sun at one focus.”![[kl1.jpg]]
- ==Kepler’s Second Law:== “As a planet moves in an orbit, a line drawn from the Sun to the Planet sweeps equal areas in equal time intervals.” This is a consequence of the Conservation of Angular Momentum which is discussed later.![[kl2.png]]
- ==Kepler’s Third Law:== “The orbital period of a planet squared is proportional to the planets radius (distance) from the focus point it is orbiting around.” The ratio is shown as: $$T^2=R^3 \space or \space \frac{T^2}{R^3}$$
## Newton’s Law of Gravitation
- All objects exert an attractive force on each other, called the gravitational force, whose strength is proportional to the product of the objects’ masses and inversely proportional to the square of the center-to-center distance between them. If G is the universal gravitational constant then the strength of the force is given by the equation: $$F_G=-\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}\hat r$$
- $$G=6.67\times10^-11 \frac{N\cdot m^2}{kg^2}$$






From NOTEBOOK LM
- Uniform circular motion occurs when an object moves in a circular path at a constant speed1 . Although the speed is constant, the velocity is not because the direction of the velocity vector is continuously changing1 .... This change in velocity implies that the object is undergoing acceleration, known as centripetal acceleration, which is always directed toward the center of the circle1 .... The magnitude of the centripetal acceleration ($a_c$) is given by the equation:

•

$a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$

•

where $v$ is the speed of the object and $r$ is the radius of the circular path.

•

This can also be expressed in terms of the angular velocity ($\omega$) using the relationship $v = r\omega$: $a_c = r\omega^2$ 

According to Newton's Second Law, an acceleration requires a net force. In the case of uniform circular motion, the net force directed toward the center of the circle is called the centripetal force ($F_c$)1 .... Its magnitude is given by:

•

$F_c = ma_c = \frac{mv^2}{r} = mr\omega^2$

It's important to understand that centripetal force is not a new fundamental force6 .... Instead, it is the net result of one or more actual forces (such as tension, friction, gravity, or the normal force) that act to keep the object moving in a circle6 .... When analyzing problems involving circular motion, it is helpful to consider all forces (or components of forces) pointing toward the center of the circle as positive and those pointing away as negative8 ....

Examples of uniform circular motion discussed in the sources include a rock on the end of a string whirled in a horizontal or vertical circle1 ..., a car moving around a circular track1 ..., and a satellite in a circular orbit around Earth1 ....

The relationship between linear and angular quantities in circular motion is fundamental:

•

Arc length ($s$) = $r\theta$

•

Linear speed ($v$) = $r\omega$

•

Tangential acceleration ($a_{tan}$) = $r\alpha$

Gravitation

The sources primarily discuss Newton's Law of Gravitation and its implications for celestial mechanics. Newton's Law of Gravitation states that every pair of objects in the universe exerts an attractive force on each other17 . The magnitude of this gravitational force ($F_g$) is directly proportional to the product of their masses ($m_1$ and $m_2$) and inversely proportional to the square of the distance ($r$) between their centers17 :

•

$F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$
•

where $G$ is the universal gravitational constant ($G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} N \cdot m^2/kg^2$)17 ....

Newton also proved that a uniform sphere attracts another body as if all of the sphere's mass were concentrated at its center21 . Conversely, a uniform spherical shell of mass exerts no gravitational force on a particle located inside it22 ....

The acceleration due to gravity ($g$) experienced by an object near a large body (like a planet of mass $M$ and radius $R$) can be derived from Newton's Law of Gravitation:

•

$mg = G \frac{Mm}{R^2} \implies g = \frac{GM}{R^2}$

•

This shows that the acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object21 ....

The concept of gravitational potential energy ($U_g$) for two masses $M$ and $m$ separated by a distance $r$ is given by:

•

$U_g = -\frac{GMm}{r}$

•

where the zero of potential energy is defined at an infinite separation ($r = \infty$).

Kepler's Laws of planetary motion are a direct consequence of Newton's Law of Gravitation20 .

•

Kepler's First Law: Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus30 ....

•

Kepler's Second Law: As a planet orbits, a line connecting the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time, which implies the conservation of angular momentum30 .

•

Kepler's Third Law: The square of the orbital period ($T$) of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis ($a$) of its elliptical orbit30 :

◦

$T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3$ ... (for circular orbits, $a = R$).

For an object in a circular orbit of radius $R$ around a mass $M$, the gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force11 ...:

•

$G \frac{Mm}{R^2} = m \frac{v^2}{R}$

This allows us to determine the orbital speed ($v$) of the satellite:

•

$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$

The total mechanical energy ($E$) of a satellite in a circular orbit is the sum of its kinetic energy ($K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$) and potential energy ($U_g = -\frac{GMm}{R}$):

•

$E = K + U_g = \frac{1}{2}m\left(\frac{GM}{R}\right) - \frac{GMm}{R} = -\frac{GMm}{2R}$36 ....

For elliptical orbits, the total energy is given by:

•

$E = -\frac{GMm}{2a}$

•

where $a$ is the semi-major axis of the ellipse.

The escape speed ($v_e$) is the minimum speed an object needs at a distance $r$ from a mass $M$ to escape its gravitational field (reach infinity with zero kinetic energy):

•

$\frac{1}{2}mv_e^2 - \frac{GMm}{r} = 0 \implies v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$
