# Incline Planes
- Incline Planes are one of the most common scenarios involving dynamics, and though they come off as challenging at first, they are simply breaking down forces into components, and solving for the unknown with algebra.
## Strategy
- To start, you need to first determine a coordinate axis, and which directions are denoted as positive or negative. This is important in calculations, and for your AP reader to understand your work. ALWAYS draw your new coordinate axis on your paper.
- Working with incline planes, the first step is to determine if the object is ACCLERATING. Normally, it is directly stated if the object is accelerated, whether it is up or down the ramp, and some questions request that you find the magnitude of the acceleration. Remember, if an object has a constant velocity or at rest, then it has NO ACCLERATION, meaning the object is in equilibrium. 
- If the object is said to be moving down the ramp, then the direction up the ramp is considered negative, making all drag forces negative and easier to identify. Conversely, if the object is accelerating up the ramp, down the ramp will represent the negative direction, so the same principles apply. If the object isn’t accelerating, it is up to interpretation, but traditionally, up the ramp is positive.
- Next, it is essential to rotate the coordinate x-axis so that the incline of the coordinate grid is parallel to the incline. Doing this allows us to only break one force into components, simplifying calculations.
- Next, draw a free-body diagram for the incline plane. Note that the coordinate plane is drawn.![](freebodydiagramofinclineinstruction1.png)
  - Notice how the angle theta of the incline plane is the angle of the force of gravity from the new y-axis. This means that in order to break gravity into components, the angle used will be the angle of the incline plane. From this, we can derive new equations. 
$$F_{gx}=F_g\sin{\theta}$$
$$F_{gy}=F_g\cos{\theta}$$
- Recalling that Force of gravity equals mass times little g,
  $$F_{gx}=mg\sin{\theta}$$$$F_{gy}=F_g\cos{\theta}$$
- The new found components mean that there is a force of gravity pulling the object down the block, and a component pulling the object straight into the incline.
- Now that we have forces along the respective axes, we now need to use the 2nd Newton’s Law for the mathematical approach. Remember that you must set up a separate equation for the x and y axes. 
## Newton’s 2nd Law Approach (y-axis)
- Starting along the y-axis, recall the 2nd Newton’s law. $${F^{net}_y}=ma_y$$
- In incline plane scenarios, there will never be a vertical acceleration, meaning you can set one side of this equation equal to zero.
  $${F^{net}_y}=0$$
- Next, set up the vector sum of the forces along the y-axis, including their direction.
  $$F_N\space +(-F_{gy})=0$$
- You are then able to solve for the normal force, which allows you to solve for the force of friction, which may or may not be required, depending on the context of the problem.
$$F_N=F_{gy}$$
- Recalling what force of gravity along the y-axis equals, you can then substitute the given values. 
$$F_N=mg\cos{\theta}$$
## Newton’s 2nd Law Approach (x-axis)
- The x-axis is definitely more complicated, due to the different possibilities, and the fact that, the object can accelerate or not complicates things.  Start with the 2nd Newton’s Law.
$$F^{net}_x=ma_x$$
- In this instance, lets assume the object does not accelerate.
$$F^{net}_x=0$$
- Create the vector sum of forces. Note that the force of gravity always pulls the object down the ramp. Remember that because there is no acceleration, the positive x is assumed to be up the ramp.
$$f_s\space + (-F_{gy})=0$$
- Note that the friction is static, because there is no motion. Isolating friction, gives you the following,
  $$f_s\space = F_{gy}$$
- Recall what the equation for static friction (2.3) and force of gravity along the y-axis equal.
  $$\mu_sF_N=mg\sin{\theta}$$
  - Recall what the normal force equals, derived from the y-axis.
  $$\mu_smg\cos{\theta} = mg\sin{\theta}$$
  - Using algebra, you can solve for any unknown quantity, but isolating mu means that…  $$\mu_s=\tan\theta$$
  …. is valid. This means that the minimum required coefficient of static friction is equal to the tangent of the angle. If the coefficient’s magnitude is greater than the coefficient of static friction, then the object will definitely not slip. This means tangent of the angle is the minimum amount of coefficient of static friction. In numerical terms...
$$\mu_s \geq \tan \theta$$
  - But what if the object was accelerating down the incline due to an applied force? Follow the same steps to derive a formula.
$$F^{net}_x=ma_x$$
- Because the object is accelerating down the ramp, there is an acceleration (down the ramp is positive).
  $$F_A+F_{gy}\space +(-f_k)=ma_x$$
$$F_A+mg\sin{\theta}\space -\space\mu_smg\cos{\theta} =ma_x$$
- Using algebra you can solve for any of the following quantities.
- If the acceleration was up the block, then the same principles apply, but gravity would be negative. 
 $$F_A+(-F_{gy})\space +(-f_k)=ma_x$$$$F_A-mg\sin{\theta}\space -\space\mu_smg\cos{\theta} =ma_x$$
- For incline planes, the main strategy is to be able to determine the direction of forces along each axis, and solve for whatever quantity is needed. These equations are for the specific situations described, and aren’t worth memorizing. The goal is for you to be able to derive these equations yourself, depending on the given scenario.
