# Uniform Circular Motion (UCM)
## Definitions and Concepts
- An object is said to be in UCM if it is travelling at a constant speed around a circular path. ==The speed is constant but the velocity is not.==
- Centripetal Acceleration, denotated by a_c, is the acceleration that changes an object’s direction, to keep it on its circular path, but not its speed. In order for there to be an acceleration there must be a force action on the object, this is the ==Centripetal Force== denoted by Fc.
- Centripetal Force always points towards the center of the circle the object is travelling along. ==The centripetal force is a NET force and does not show up on FBDs.==
- The object has a centripetal acceleration, and a tangential velocity, which is the velocity the object has perpendicular to the centripetal acceleration. In other words, the tangential velocity is how fast the object is moving around the circle, and the centripetal acceleration is how fast the object is accelerating towards the center. 
- Note that because circular motion always has an acceleration towards the radial center of the circle, the object in UCM will never be in equilibrium.  
#### Types of UCM Circles
- ==Horizontal Circles== are cases where gravity can be neglected because the object is rotating on the x-axis. Think of the point on the outside edge of helicopter blades, the point moves in a circle with its motion unaffected by gravity.
- ==Vertical Circles== are cases where gravity must be considered because the object is rotating on the y-axis. Think of a rollercoaster, the car moves in a “loop” but accelerates downward due to gravity.

## Formulas
- The formula for the centripetal acceleration shown on the reference sheet is: $$\boxed{a_c = \frac{v_t^2}{r}}$$
- Plugging this in to Newton’s 2nd Law, where Fc is the NET force, we get: $$F_c=ma_c=m\frac{v_t^2}{r}$$
- Note that the tangential velocity, radius, and centripetal acceleration are a ratio, that must meet the following standards.
	- If $a_c = \frac{v_t^2}{r}$, objects maintain UCM
	- If $a_c \geq \frac{v_t^2}{r}$, objects spiral inward
	-  If $a_c \leq \frac{v_t^2}{r}$, objects spiral outward
# Gravitation and Planetary Motion
## Kepler’s Laws
- ==Kepler’s First Law:== “Every planet moves in an elliptical orbit, with the Sun at one focus.”![[kl1.jpg]]
- ==Kepler’s Second Law:== “As a planet moves in an orbit, a line drawn from the Sun to the Planet sweeps equal areas in equal time intervals.” This is a consequence of the Conservation of Angular Momentum which is discussed later.![[kl2.png]]
- ==Kepler’s Third Law:== “The orbital period of a planet squared is proportional to the planets radius (distance) from the focus point it is orbiting around.” The ratio is shown as: $$T^2 \propto R^3$$
	- *Derivation:* If the orbit is ==circular (ellipse with eccentricity of zero)== then v must be constant so the object is in UCM (The force of gravity provides the Fc). The time an object takes to orbit a planet once (orbital period) equals distance divided by velocity.$$\array{ F_G &=& F_c \cr \frac{GMm}{R^2} &=& \frac{mv^2}{R} \cr T &=& \frac{2\pi r}{v} \cr T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2R^2}{v^2} &=& \frac{4\pi^2R^2}{GM/R} = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}R^3 \cr \frac{T^2}{R^3} &=& \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}, a \space constant}$$

## Newton’s Law of Gravitation
- All objects exert an attractive force on each other, called the gravitational force, whose strength is proportional to the product of the objects’ masses and inversely proportional to the square of the center-to-center distance between them. If G is the universal gravitational constant then the strength of the force is given by the equation: $$F_G=-\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}\hat r$$
- $$G=6.67\times10^-11 \frac{N\cdot m^2}{kg^2}$$
- The acceleration of gravity is derived by setting Fg = ma and plugging in newton’s law of gravitation, then canceling the masses. ==This is the reason object’s falling near the surface of Earth have the same acceleration and aren’t affected by mass.== $$a_g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$
## Gravitational Shells
- A uniform sphere attracts another body as if all of the sphere’s mass were concentrated at its center.
- Additionally, a uniform shell of mass does not exert a gravitational force on a particle inside it. ==Only the mass of the sphere *underneath* us exerts a gravitational force.==
- $$F \tiny grav \normalsize = \array{ \frac{GMm}{R^3}x & for \space x<R \cr \frac{GMm}{x^2} & for \space x\ge R}$$
	- For x values that are greater than R you can use the equation for the force of gravity directly.
	- For x values that are smaller than the R you must note that only the shell of mass beneath that point exerts a gravitational force. So you must use find the relationship that relates the shell’s mass to the planet’s. $$\frac{M\tiny within \space x}{M} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi x^3 \rho}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \rho} = \frac{x^3}{R^3} \to M\tiny within \space x \normalsize = \frac{x^3}{R^3}M$$ Then we can plug this back into the equation for the force of gravity: $$F_G =G\frac{\frac{x^3}{R^3}M\cdot m}{x^2} = G\frac{Mm}{R^3}x \quad \color {darkorange} (x<R)$$
