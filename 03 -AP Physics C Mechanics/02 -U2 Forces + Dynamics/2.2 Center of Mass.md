# Center of Mass
## Uniform Density
- The point where all the mass of an object can be considered to be concentrated; it will be the point we draw a dot at in a FBD (free body diagram), this will be used later in the unit.
- For a homogeneous body (uniform density throughout), the center of mass is at the geometric center.
- We can solve for the CM mathematically by considering the case where all particles lie on a straight line. Then determine the positions of each particle, multiply them by the mass of the particle at each location, and finally divide by the total mass.
- The formula for the CM in the x-axis is: $$x\tiny cm\normalsize = \frac{m_1x_1+m_2x_2+...+m_nx_n}{m_1+m_2+...+m_n}$$This equation will give you the x coordinate of the CM
- If the system consists of objects that are not confined to the same straight line you must use another equation to find the y coordinate of the CM: $$y\tiny cm \normalsize = \frac{m_1y_1+m_2y_2+...+m_ny_x}{m_1+m_2+...+m_n}$$
- In the equation sheet for AP Physics C the formula will be represented as: $$\boxed {r\tiny cm \normalsize = \Sigma mr / \Sigma m}$$ where r is the x or y value you are solving for.
