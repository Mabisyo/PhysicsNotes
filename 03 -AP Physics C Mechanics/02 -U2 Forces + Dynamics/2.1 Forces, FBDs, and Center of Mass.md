# Definitions and Concepts
Forces are the core of Newtonian physics.  They represent the interactions that cause a change in an objects motion. Forces are the foundational understanding for the rest of the course.
- There are many different types of forces, and they can each be categorized into Contact or Non-Contact forces.
- Forces interact with objects all the time, and the forces acting on an object can represented using free-body diagrams. 
- The center of Mass is the point on an object where all forces are considered to “act on.”
- Forces are represented in Newtons, 1N = 1kg times 1m/s^2
# Different types of Forces
- Forces can be categorized into 2 main types, ==Contact and Non-Contact Forces (aka field forces)==. As the name suggests, contact forces, such as a push or a pull require physical contact, while Field forces act upon a distance, such as gravity.
- Though not needed for this course, there are 4 main fundamental forces, responsible for the existence of the universe.
	- ==Gravity:== The weakest of the 4 forces, has infinite range, responsible for attraction of 2 objects with mass.
	- ==Weak Nuclear Force:== Stronger than gravity, weaker than electromagnetism, very short range, responsible for certain types of radioactive decay.
	- ==Electromagnetism:== Stronger than weak nuclear force, infinite range, responsible for interactions between electrically charged particles.
	- ==Strong Nuclear Force:== Strongest of the 4 forces, shortest range, holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus.
- The list of forces required includes, but not limited to…
	- ==Applied Force==: Force done by a person, represented by F sub A
	- ==Gravitational Force:== Force done by Earth, or another planet, F sub g
	- ==Normal Force:== Force done by a surface on an object, important for calculations, F sub N
	- ==Frictional Force:== Force generated between 2 surfaces. It is either Kinetic Friction if the object is in motion (f sub k), and Static Friction if the object isn’t moving (f sub s).
	- ==Air Resistance Forces:== Force done opposite to an objects motion when in an area with air (non-vacuum), f sub air.
	- ==Tension Force:== Force done by a string or rope, that is always a pull, F sub T.
	- ==Spring Force:== Force done by a spring, requires Hooke’s law, represented as F sub s.
	Note that all drag forces are represented with a lowercase F.
# Free Body Diagram Representation
- Free Body Diagrams disregards the environment, and disregards the geometric shape of the object. However, if the shape and environment is relevant, then it can be included.
- All arrows are drawn away from the center of mass. The arrows represent direction, and the length represents the magnitude of each force.

# Center of Mass
Center of Mass is the point in the object where all forces act. Center of mass goes hand and hand with density. If the object has uniform or non-uniform density, then use the according formula.
## Uniform Density
- For a homogeneous body (uniform density throughout), the center of mass is at the geometric center.
- We can solve for the CM mathematically by considering the case where all particles lie on a straight line. Then determine the positions of each particle, multiply them by the mass of the particle at each location, and finally divide by the total mass.
- The formula for the CM in the x-axis is: $$x\tiny cm\normalsize = \frac{m_1x_1+m_2x_2+...+m_nx_n}{m_1+m_2+...+m_n}$$This equation will give you the x coordinate of the CM, and to find the center of mass of a 2D or 3D object, find the center of mass along each axis, y and z.
- In the equation sheet for AP Physics C the formula will be represented as: $$\boxed {r\tiny cm \normalsize = \frac{\Sigma mr}{\Sigma m}}$$ where r is the x or y value you are solving for.
- The equation can also be represented as an integral: $$\boxed{r\tiny cm \normalsize = \frac{\intop \vec r \space dm}{\intop dm}}$$
## Non-uniform Density
- When working with an object with a non-uniform density, use the following integral.$$ \frac{1}{m}\int\limits_{0}^{Length} x \, dm$$
- Where M is mass, length is how long the dimension is, x for the length of the side, and dm for an infinitesimally small amount of mass.
