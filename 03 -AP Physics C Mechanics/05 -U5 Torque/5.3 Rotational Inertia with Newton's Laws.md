- In turn, to solve for the magnitude, you can rewrite the formula as…$$\tau = F*r*\sin\theta$$
  - Also note, that as the distance from the axis of rotation increases, so does the magnitude of torque.
  - Because Torque is a force, Newton’s 2nd Law applies, but new variables apply.$$\tau^{net}=I*\alpha $$
- Remember, 1 axis means no components are needed, meaning that when solving for net torque, only 1 equation is needed. 
- The substitute for acceleration was angular acceleration, and the substitute for mass is rotational inertia, or moment of inertia. See 5.3.
