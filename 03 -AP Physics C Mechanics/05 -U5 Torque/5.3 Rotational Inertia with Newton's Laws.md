# Rotational Inertia
## Definitions and Concepts
- Just like there are rotational equivalents for net forces, and linear acceleration there is also one for mass:

| Equivalents   |                |            |       |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Translational | $$F^{NET}$$    | $$a$$      | $$m$$ |
| Rotational    | $$\tau^{NET}$$ | $$\alpha$$ | $$I$$ |
- This newfound variable is called rotational inertia, denoted by I, as seen above.
- We can solve for this new variable by subbing in our equivalents in Newton’s 2nd Law.
	- $$\array{ F = ma \cr F=mr\alpha, \space \color {orange} since \space a=r\alpha \color {lightgray} \cr rF = mr^2 \alpha, \color {orange} multiply \space by \space r \space to \space get \space torque \space on \space the \space left \cr \tau = mr^2 \alpha}$$
	- We can see that we have torque, our force equivalent, on the left and our rotational acceleration, linear equivalent, on the right which leaves the mass equivalent in the middle.
	- Because of this we now know that the the rotational inertia for a point mass at a distance r from the AOR (axis-of-rotation) is defined as:$$I = mr^2$$
## Formulas
- The rotational inertia of a point mass a distance of r from the AOR: $$I = mr^2$$
- All the point masses that comprise the object make up the total rotational inertia: $$I = \varSigma m_ir_i^2$$
- This can be used to find Net Torque: $$\varSigma \tau_i = (\varSigma m_ir_i^2)\alpha \space \color {magenta} \to \color {lightgray} \space \tau^{Net} = I\alpha$$
- For a continuous solid body this becomes: $$\boxed{I = \intop r^2 \space dm}$$
	- **==DERIVATION FOR A HOMOGENOUS OBJECT’S ROTATIONAL INERTIA==**:![[RI 1.png]] $$\array{ I = \intop r^2 \space dm \cr dm = \rho(2\pi rh), \space \color {orange} mass(dm) = density * volume(dv) \cr I = \intop_{r=0}^{r=R} r^2 (\rho 2\pi rh) \cr I = 2\pi h\rho \intop_{0}^{R} r^3 \space dr \cr I = 2\pi h\rho (\frac{r^4}{4}) \cr I = \frac{\pi h\rho r^4}{2} \cr I = \frac{mr^2}{2}, \space \color {orange} mass = density  * volume, m = \rho (\pi r^2h) \cr I = \frac{mr^2}{2}}$$
# Parallel Axis-Theorem
## Definitions and Concepts
- If the rotational inertia of a body is known relative to an axis that passes through the body’s center of mass, then the rotational inertia relative to any other rotation axis (parallel to the first one) can be calculated using the parallel axis theorem.
## Formula
- The parallel axis theorem, calculating the rotational inertia of a body relative to any other rotation axis using the rotational inertia of the axis that passes through the body’s center of mass: $$I' = I_{cm} + mx^2$$
