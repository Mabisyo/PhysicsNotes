- Recall back to kinematics, where the following kinematic equations allowed for one to solve for the missing variable, in 1d motion with constant acceleration. 
- When working in rotational and angular motion, new variables need to be developed.

- Assume an object starts at point A, a distance r, from the middle of the circle, and the object rotates to point B, over an arc length, S.
- The change in the angle, or the angular displacement, is the change in angle from 2 points in an objects motion. It is represented in by delta theta, and the units is radians.
- The rate of change of the angular displacement, is the angular velocity, represented by omega, and the units is radians per second.
- The rate of change of the angular velocity, is the angular acceleration, represented by alpha, and the units is radians per second squared.
- Translational Motion and Angular Motion follow the same kinematic principles, and in turn, their quantities are easily comparable.

|   Quantity   |      Translational Motion       |               Angular Motion               |
| :----------: | :-----------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
|   Position   | $x_i\space x_f \space \Delta x$ | $\theta_i\space\theta_f\space\Delta\theta$ |
|   Velocity   |         $v_f\space v_i$         |       $\omega_i\space\omega_f\space$       |
| Acceleration |         $a_f\space a_i$         |         $\alpha_f \space \alpha_i$         |
- Because such quantities are related, the kinematic equations are exactly the same, but in angular form.
  $$\omega=\omega_{0}+\alpha t$$$$\Delta\theta=\omega_{0}t+\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}{\omega}t^{2}$$ $$\omega^{2}=\omega_{0}^{2}+2\alpha\Delta\theta$$
  - Such equations appear on the equation sheet.
- Angular displacement, velocity, and acceleration are also related with arc lengths, and their radius. S is the arc length.
  $$\Delta\theta=\frac{\Delta S}{r}$$
  $$\Delta\theta=\omega *\Delta t$$
  $$\omega=\alpha*\Delta t$$
  $$v_t=r*\omega$$
  
- Tangential velocity can also accelerate, with the following formula.
$$a_t=r*\alpha$$
- Objects will angularly accelerate with the angular equivalent of force, being Torque. 
# Alternate derivable equations
- Note that we are working in radians.
- Given the following equation.
 $$\Delta\theta=\omega *\Delta t$$Recall that an entire circle is 2pi radians.
 $$\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=T$$
 The new derived “T” is denoted as the period, or the time in which the object takes to make a full revolution around the circle.
 - There are other formulas that equal the period, such as,
$$T=\frac{1}{f}$$
- Where f is the frequency.
$$T= \frac{2\pi r}{v_t}$$
- Recall the following formula
  $$a_c=\frac{v_t^2}{r}$$
  Plugging in $\frac{2\pi r}{T}$ for $v^2_t$, you get
 $$a_c=\frac{(\frac{2\pi r}{t})^2}{r}$$
 This simplifies to…
$$a_c=r(\frac{2\pi}{T})^2$$
