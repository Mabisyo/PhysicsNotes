- Torque is essentially, the rotational motion equivalent of force in translational motion, repersented by the Greek letter, Tao.
- Torque is responsible for angular acceleration, and it depends on 2 factors, distance from the axis of rotation, and the perpendicular force applied.
- The axis of rotation could be inside of the object, causing it to rotate, or it could be outside the object, causing it to spin around that point.
- Positive Torques are considered to be when rotations accelerate counterclockwise, and negative torques are clockwise angular accelerations.
- The direction of torque is derived from the cross product of 2 the cross product of the radius and force. Recall the cross product diagram.

  - In this example, imagine that the first, stationary vector, is the radius from the axis of rotation, and the spinning object is the force vector. A lot of meaning can be derived from this diagram.
    - Note that the more perpendicular the forces are, the higher the magnitude of the 3rd vector. This means, the more perpendicular the force vector is to the radius, or the “lever arm,” the greater the magnitude of Torque.
    - When the 2 vectors are parallel (or antiparallel), the cross product of the 2 vector is zero, meaning Torque will have a magnitude of zero.
    - When the vector spins counterclockwise, the vector is positive, and when the vector spins clockwise, the cross product is negative.
    - Because the torque only exists on 1 axis, there is no component breakdown, there is only one direction with its positive and negative direction.
- Torque as stated before, is the cross product of the lever arm (distance from the axis of rotation) and the applied force.
  $$\tau=F \times r $$
- In turn, to solve for the magnitude, you can rewrite the formula as…$$\tau = F*r*\sin\theta$$
  - Also note, that as the distance from the axis of rotation increases, so does the magnitude of torque.
  - Because Torque is a force, Newton’s 2nd Law applies, but new variables apply.$$\tau^{net}=I*\alpha $$
- Remember, 1 axis means no components are needed, meaning that when solving for net torque, only 1 equation is needed. 
- The substitute for acceleration was angular acceleration, and the substitute for mass is rotational inertia, or moment of inertia. See 5.3.
