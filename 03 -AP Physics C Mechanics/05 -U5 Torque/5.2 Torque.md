# Torque
## Definitions and Concepts
- ==Torque== describes the effectiveness of a force in producing rotational acceleration. ==Torque is the rotational equivalent of force in translational motion.==
- Torque is a vector quantity that produces **angular acceleration**.
- Torque can be thought of as positive if the rotation it produces is counterclockwise (CCW) and negative if the rotation it produces is clockwise (CW).
- Torque is denoted by the Greek letter, Tau: **τ** and has units of Newton-meters: (N·m)
- Instinctively, there is no torque when a force acts on the pivot itself. Additionally, when the angle between the force and pivot is 180 or 0 then the torque done will be 0. This is because torque is dependent on 2 factors, distance from the axis of rotation (pivot) and the perpendicular force applied.
- The expression that represents this is: $$\tau = rF \sin \theta$$ where r is the distance, from the pivot, of the force and theta is the smallest angle between vectors r and F. 
- There is another way to determine the value of torque using the lever arm (l), sometimes called the moment arm or moment of the force, and the line of action of F:

- The formula can be written as: $$\tau = lF$$
but since l is equal to the component of r that is perpendicular to F it can be written both: $$\tau = r_\perp F \color {magenta} \to \color {white} \tau = rF_\perp$$
## Right Hand Rule (RHR)
- The direction of torque is derived from the cross product of 2 the cross product of the radius and force. Recall the cross product diagram.

  - In this example, imagine that the first, stationary vector, is the radius from the axis of rotation, and the spinning object is the force vector. A lot of meaning can be derived from this diagram.
    - Note that the more perpendicular the forces are, the higher the magnitude of the 3rd vector. This means, the more perpendicular the force vector is to the radius, or the “lever arm,” the greater the magnitude of Torque.
    - When the 2 vectors are parallel (or antiparallel), the cross product of the 2 vector is zero, meaning Torque will have a magnitude of zero.
    - When the vector spins counterclockwise, the vector is positive, and when the vector spins clockwise, the cross product is negative.
    - Because the torque only exists on 1 axis, there is no component breakdown, there is only one direction with its positive and negative direction.
- You can use the Right Hand Rule on the test to determine the direction of torque, but not the magnitude. This helps for questions that require basic conceptual knowledge to determine the movement of a system.
	- Start by placing your hand, open, in the direction of the radius vector.
	- Then, curl your fingers in (like you would make a fist) towards the direction of the force vector.
	- **YOU MUST SWEEP THE SMALLEST ANGLE**, in order to accomplish this you may need to flip your hand over.
	- You may NOT use your left hand to do this trick, doing so would result in the wrong direction of torque.

## Formulas
- Torque found by using r and the component of F that is perpendicular to r. $$\tau = rF \sin \theta$$
- Torque found by using the Force and Lever Arm, the perpendicular component of r. $$\tau = lF = r_\perp F = rF_\perp$$
- The equation for torque on the formula sheet will appear as: $$\boxed{\tau = r\times F}$$
