- Recall back to kinematics, where the following kinematic equations allowed for one to solve for the missing variable, in 1d motion with constant acceleration. 
  $$\boxed{\vec{v_f}=\vec{v_i}+\vec{a}*t}$$
  $$\boxed{\vec{x_f}=\vec{x_i}+\vec{v_i}*t+\frac{1}{2}\vec{a}*t^2}$$
  $$\boxed{\vec{v_f}^2=\vec{v_i}^2+2\vec{a}*\Delta\vec{x}}$$
  - When working in rotational and angular motion, new variables need to be developed.
