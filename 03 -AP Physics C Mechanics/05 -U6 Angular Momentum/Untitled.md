**Challenge Problem**
A disc of mass M and radius r is at rest and attached to a frictionless axle. At the top of the disc is a massless cup which opens to the left. A ball of mass m is travelling to the right at a speed v when it runs into the cup and is caught. The ball sticks to the bottom of the cup, causing the disc to rotate. This is an inelastic collision, indicating that kinetic energy was lost. Prove that the amount of energy lost is equal to: $$ E\tiny lost \normalsize = \frac {Mmv^2}{4m+2M} $$
	How to solve:
		1) Find the initial kinetic energy of the system, right before the ball collides with the disc.
		2) Find the find the final kinetic energy of the system, right after the ball collides with the disc.
		3) Find the difference between the final and initial kinetic energies.
