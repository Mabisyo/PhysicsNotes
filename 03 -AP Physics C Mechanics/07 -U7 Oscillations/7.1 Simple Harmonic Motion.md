A spring of spring constant *k*, measured in *N/m*, has an equilibrium length. An object of mass *m* attached to that spring may be displaced from that equilibrium length by a displacement *x.* Let’s set up a number line such that when the object is at the spring’s equilibrium length, x=0. When the spring is compressed, the object has a negative x value for position, and when the spring is stretched, the object’s position is positive. According to Hooke’s Law, the force exerted by the spring on the object is equal to the below expression. Note that when the object’s position is positive, the force points in the negative direction, and vice versa.

$$ F\tiny s \normalsize = -kx $$
According to Newton’s First Law, the acceleration of that object, as a function of position, is: $$ a = -\frac {kx}{m} $$
To derive the period of a spring, we will assume the spring was originally compressed to a position d. Let’s use the Conservation of Mechanical Energy to derive an expression for the object’s velocity as a function of position. Recall that since we are only considering a half-period, the object’s velocity will always be positive.
$$ KE\tiny i \normalsize \space + \space U\tiny i \normalsize \space + \space W\tiny nonconservative \normalsize = KE\tiny f \normalsize \space + \space U\tiny f \normalsize $$
$$ 0 + \frac12 kd^2 + 0 = \frac12 mv^2 + \frac12 kx^2$$
$$v = \sqrt \frac km \sqrt (d^2-x^2)$$
