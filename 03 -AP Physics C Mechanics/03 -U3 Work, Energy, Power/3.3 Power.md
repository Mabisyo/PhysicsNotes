# Power
## Definitions and Concepts
 * ==Power== is the rate at which work gets done (or energy gets transferred). If I do 1000 J of work in 2 minutes while you do the same work in 1 minute you were more powerful. Power equals the work divided by the time it took to do the work.
 * ==The unit for power is Joules per second (J/s), called the watt (W)==, not to be confused with the symbol for work. $$1 \space W = 1 \space J/s$$
 * 1 horsepower (used in America to define how power an engine is) is equal to 746 W. $$1 \space hp = 746 \space W$$
## Formulas
- The formula for power is: $$Power = \frac{Work}{Time} \color {magenta} \to \color {white} P = \frac{W}{t}$$
- On the equation sheet this will be shown as: $$\boxed{P_{avg} = \frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}}$$
* Since power is a rate it can also be expressed as a derivative, on the equation sheet for mechanics it will be shown as: $$\boxed{P_{inst} = \frac{dW}{dt}}$$
* Since the formula for Work equals: $$W = F\bullet \Delta x$$ we can sub W into the equation for power: $$P = \frac{F\bullet \Delta x}{t}$$ and since Δx/t is equal to displacement over time we can rewrite it to be velocity, resulting in another formulas for power: $$P = F•v$$
