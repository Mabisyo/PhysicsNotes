Problem 4: A block of mass m = 2.0 kg is placed on a frictionless inclined plane with an angle of θ=30° to the horizontal. The block is released from rest at a height h = 5.0 m above the base of the incline. 
a) Calculate the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the incline.
b) Determine the work done by the gravitational force on the block as it moves down the incline.
c) If the block were to encounter a constant frictional force of f=4.0 N while moving down the incline, calculate the speed of the block at the bottom of the incline.

## Practice Problems
1) A mass *m* is pulled a distance *d* up an incline  (angle of elevation *θ*) at a constant speed using a rope that is parallel to the incline. The coefficient of kinetic friction is *μ*.
	(a) What is the magnitude of the tension force in the rope? The normal force?
	(b) What is the work done by the normal force? Kinetic friction? The tension force? What is the net work?
	(c) What is the change in the total mechanical energy? Show that this is equal to the  work performed by nonconservative forces. In other words, prove that this scenario adheres to the principle: $$ \Delta E\tiny mech \normalsize = W\tiny nonconservative $$
2) A mass *m* attached to a string of length 2*r* swings, starting at rest when the string is horizontal, until the string is vertical. At the instant the string is vertical, the mass makes contact with a horizontal surface, the string is cut, and the mass continues along a frictionless track as shown in the below image.

	(b) Sketch the forces acting on the mass when it is in the position shown in the above image.
	(c) Find the object’s speed and centripetal force as functions of *θ*. 
	(d) Determine at what angle *θ* the mass will fall off the track.
