Problem 4: A block of mass m = 2.0 kg is placed on a frictionless inclined plane with an angle of θ=30° to the horizontal. The block is released from rest at a height h = 5.0 m above the base of the incline. 
a) Calculate the speed of the block when it reaches the bottom of the incline.
b) Determine the work done by the gravitational force on the block as it moves down the incline.
c) If the block were to encounter a constant frictional force of f=4.0 N while moving down the incline, calculate the speed of the block at the bottom of the incline.
