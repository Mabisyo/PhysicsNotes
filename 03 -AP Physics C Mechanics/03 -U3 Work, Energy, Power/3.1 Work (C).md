## Definitions
* ==Work==: A way to transfer energy from one system to another. Work is a force applied over a distance.
	* The formula for Work is shown as:$$W= \intop F â€¢ dr$$
		* The force in consideration is denotated by *F*, and *dr* represents an infinitesimally small displacement.
	* If the force is constant, it may be removed from the integral to result in: $$W=F\intop dr$$ which can be simplified using the **==DOT product==** to become: $$W = (Fcos\theta)r$$
		* Note that Work is the result of a DOT product multiplication so it is a *scalar* quantity, HOWEVER it can still be negative. A resulting negative value means the work done by that force is dissipating energy from the system. Another result of the DOT product is that only the component of force that is parallel to the displacement does any work.
		* Any component of a force that is perpendicular to the direction that an object moves cannot do work because the displacement in that direction is zero. $$0 = F\tiny orce\normalsize \perp D\tiny istance\normalsize$$
		* The Unit for work is Joules, denotated by J, also expressed as Newtons times meters.
