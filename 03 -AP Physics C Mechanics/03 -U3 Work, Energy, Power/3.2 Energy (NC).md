# Kinetic Energy
## Definitions and Concepts
- ==Kinetic Energy==: the energy an object posses by virtue of its motion.
- *Derivation*: (Not required for the AP Exam) An object that starts at rest has a steady force exerted on it, the object’s acceleration is equal to the Net force divided by the mass. We can use the Big Five #5 equation to solve this. $$v^2 = v_i^2 + 2a(x-x_i) = 2a\Delta x = 2 \frac{F_{net}}{m}\Delta x \to F_{net}\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
- The net force times displacement is equal to the total Work done on an object, the total work done on an object has transferred energy to it, in the form of kinetic energy.
- The equation on the AP Physics C exam reference sheet will be shown as:$$\boxed{K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2}$$
# Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
## Definition

* ==Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem:== Work is the change in an object's kinetic energy due to the action of a given force. The formula for the Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem is:$$W \tiny total\normalsize = \Delta K$$
  Understand that this expands into…
  $$\int^{length}_{0} F^{net} • dr=\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2$$
*  Just like work, kinetic energy is a scalar quantity.

## Derivation (Not required for AP Exam)
May help understand conceptually. Based in two dimensions, but it can be extended to three by adding a *z* component: 
Definition of work $$ dW=F • dr $$Apply Newton’s 2nd Law and split a•dr into the *x* and *y* components $$ dW=ma•dr=m(a\tiny x\normalsize dx \space+\space a\tiny y\normalsize dy) $$Substitute the definition of acceleration and commute the differentials$$ dW=m(\frac {dv\tiny x}{dt}dx \space+\space \frac {dv\tiny y}{dt}dy)=m(\frac {dx}{dt}dv\tiny x \normalsize \space+\space \frac{dy}{dt}dv\tiny y \normalsize)$$ Substitute the definition of velocity –>$$ dW=m(v\tiny x \normalsize \space dv\tiny x \normalsize \space+\space v\tiny y \normalsize \space dv\tiny y \normalsize) $$ Integrate and distribute the integral within the parentheses
		$$ \int dW=\int m(v\tiny x \normalsize \space dv\tiny x \normalsize \space+\space v\tiny y \normalsize \space dv\tiny y \normalsize)= m(\int v\tiny x \normalsize \space dv\tiny x \normalsize \space+\space \int v\tiny y \normalsize \space dv\tiny y \normalsize) $$
Evaluate the integrals and for the right side, evaluate from the initial velocity to the final velocity since we integrated with respect to a changing velocity $$ W=m[\frac 12 v \tiny x \normalsize^2 + \frac 12 v \tiny y \normalsize^2] \tiny vi \normalsize ^{vf} $$ Factor out the 1/2 and plug in the bounds of integration  $$ W=\frac 12m[(v \tiny xf \normalsize ^2 \space+\space v \tiny yf \normalsize ^2)-(v \tiny xi \normalsize ^2 \space+\space v \tiny yi \normalsize ^2)] $$ Apply the Pythagorean theorem for the components of two dimensional velocity and distribute the m/2 $$ W=\frac 12m(v \tiny f \normalsize ^2 - v \tiny i \normalsize ^2)=\frac 12mv \tiny f \normalsize ^2 \space-\space \frac 12mv \tiny i \normalsize ^2 $$ On the right side are the mathematical definitions of the final and initial kinetic energies, and the difference between them is the change in kinetic energy –>$$W = K_f -K_i = \Delta K$$
## Important Theorems
- The work done by conservative forces is equal to the negative change in potential energy of a system. Conservative force examples are springs and gravity. $$W^{C} = -\Delta U$$
- The work done by non-conservative forces is equal to the change in total mechanical energy of a system as energy is dissipated, sound, heat, light. $$W^{NC} = \Delta E$$
# Potential Energy
## Definitions and Concepts
- Potential energy is independent from motion; ==it arises from the object’s position== (or system’s configuration.)
- Because there are different types of forces, there are different types of potential energy: ==Gravitational potential energy (Ug)== is the energy stored by the virtue of an object’s position in a gravitational field. ==Elastic potential energy (Us)== is the energy stored by elastic objects and their potential energy to return to their equilibrium point.
## Formulas
- The change in gravitational potential energy is equal to the negative work done by gravity: $$\Delta U_g = -W_{by \space gravity}$$
- If an object of mass m is raised a height h then the increase in the object’s gravitational potential energy is: $$\Delta U_g = mgh$$
- These formulas come from gravity’s nature of being a conservative force, regardless of the path taken from an object’s initial position to its final position, the work done by gravity will be the same.
# Conservation of Mechanical Energy
## Definitions and Concepts
- Combing the two forms of energy we have seen so far, Kinetic Energy (K) and Potential Energy (U) we result in the object’s total mechanical energy (E). ==E = K + U==
- ==If there are no non-conservative forces (like friction) acting on an object or system as it undergoes some change then mechanical energy is conserved==, meaning the initial mechanical energy equals the final.
## Formulas
- Formulas for total mechanical energy: $$E = K + U$$
- Formula for the conservation of mechanical energy: $$K_i + U_i = K_f + U_f$$ ==HOWEVER, this only holds true if there are no non-mechanical forces doing work==. If there are such forces doing work then you need to account for this in the equation: $$K_i + U_i +W^{NC} = K_f + U_f$$
# Energy Curves
## Definitions and Concepts
- The behavior of a system can be analyzed if we are given a graph of its potential energy, U(x), and its mechanical energy, E.
- 
## Formula
- Since E = K + U then we can plug in the equation of the potential energy graph: $$E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + U(x)$$
- We can then use this equation and solve for the velocity at any point, x. $$v = \pm \sqrt {\frac{2}{m}[E-U(x)]}$$
- The limit as x approaches zero (instant) of the variable force which does work over a small displacement.
$$F(x) = -\frac{dU}{dx}$$
## Example (LONG)
- This graph shows how the potential energy, U, varies with positions, x. A particular value of the total energy, E = constant, is also shown. Motion of an object whose potential energy is given by U(x) and which has a mechanical energy of E is confined to the region –xmax ≤ x ≤ xmax, because only in this range is E ≥ U(x). At each position x in this range, the kinetic energy K = E – U(x) is positive. However, if x > xmax (or if x <–xmax), then U(x) > E, which is physically impossible because the difference, E – U(x), which should give K, is negative. 
- In this specific energy curve the equation for U(x) describes one of the most important systems (a simple harmonic oscillator): $$U(x) = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$$![[Ecurve2.png]]
- Accounting for a variable form of the force F = F(x), which does the work W over a displacement Δx then we have: $$\Delta U(x) = -W = -F(x)\Delta x \color {magenta} \to \color {white} F(x) = -\frac{\Delta U(x)}{\Delta x}$$
- If we express this function as a limit where x approaches 0 then we get: $$F(x) = -\frac{dU}{dx}$$
- Plugging in our U(x) function from our scenario we get: $$F(x) = -(\frac{d}{dx})(\frac{1}{2}kx^2) = -kx$$ which describes a linear restoring force (prerequisite of simple harmonic motion.) This equation ==F(x) = -kx== is called ==Hooke’s Law== and is obeyed by ideal springs.
- Using this information we can see if x is positive (and not greater than xmax) then U(x) is increasing, so dU/dx is positive, which means that F (restorative force) is negative. This means the oscillator feels a force—and acceleration—in the negative direction, pulling it back through the origin (x=0). Conversely, the opposite will happen if x is negative (and not less than -xmax).
- Furthermore, the difference between E and U, which is K, decreases as x approaches xmax (or as x approaches –xmax), dropping to zero at these points. The fact that K decreases to zero at ±xmax tells us that the oscillator’s speed decreases to zero as it approaches these endpoints. It then changes direction and heads back toward the origin—where its kinetic energy and speed are maximized—for another oscillation.
- The origin is a point at which U(x) has a minimum, so the tangent line to the curve at this point is horizontal meaning the slope is zero. Since F = –dU/dx, the force F is 0 at this point. This means that this is a point of equilibrium. If the oscillator is pushed from this equilibrium point in either direction, the force F(x) will attempt to restore it to x = 0, so this is a point of stable equilibrium. However, a point where the U(x) curve has a maximum is also a point of equilibrium, but it’s an unstable one, because if the system were moved from this point in either direction, the force would accelerate it away from the equilibrium position.
