# Course Description
 AP Physics C: Mechanics is a college based physics course, incorporating calculus concepts to reinforce and further build upon the AP Physics 1 Mechanics concepts. This course covers “Newtonian Mechanics,” which is considered the fundamentals of Physics, and all other concepts developed in later Physics classes build on these foundations.
 
# Course Requirements
This course has a list of prerequisites, which are required for the course.
- Students must have taken, or be taking, a Calculus 1 class, or its equivalents.
- Though not required, having already taken AP Physics 1 would allow for an easier learning process.
- A TI-84 calculator is required, and a newer one such as TI-84 Plus CE is recommended for its flexibility and newer features. 
- Along with the Obsidian notes, a personal notebook or document to take notes yourself and workout problems is recommended.

# Course Overview
This course covers a list of Units, and each unit is weighted on the exam differently. As of 2026, the list of units and their weight on the exam is given below. ![](apcmechunitweight.png)
- Note that Fluids isn’t included in the AP Physics C: Mechanics course, but it is included in the AP Physics 1 course.
# Course Skills
The AP Physics C: Mechanics exam tests not only the content of the course, but the skills developed throughout the course. The main skills are listed below
- Creating graphical representations and diagrams to represent certain situations, which include correct scales and units, including qualitative and quantitative data.
- Deriving correct equations from a given situation to calculate a factor in terms of other factors, and plugging in numbers to calculate a value for the derived factor.
- Ability to interpret correlational relationships between two quantities, through equations and situations, and predicting the outcome of one variable if another variable is changed.
- Creating experimental procedures that test a given situation, and can test the validity of the concepts taught in the course, and justify the results by connecting concepts from various units.

# AP End of Year Exam
The AP exam consists of multiple choice questions, (MCQs) and free response questions (FRQs). As of 2026, the exam is structured as such…

- The recommended time per question is 2 minutes, and the recommended FRQ pace is 25 minutes per FRQ.
- Calculator Notes are allowed, and provided in the Obsidian.
