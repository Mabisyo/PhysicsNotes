**Unit 3: Work, Energy, and Power**
	Definition of a Joule, the unit for work and energy: $$ J = N\space m = \frac {kg \space m^2}{s^2} $$
	Definition of work: $$ W = F•r $$
	For a variable force F: $$ dW = F•dr $$And if *F* and *r* are parallel: $$ W = \intop F\tiny x \normalsize \space dx$$
	Work-Energy Theorem: $$ W=\Delta KE = -\Delta U$$
	Kinetic energy: $$ KE=\frac 12 mv^2 $$
	Gravitational potential energy (y is height relative to where you set y=0): $$ U\tiny g \normalsize =mgy $$
	Force of a spring, according to Hooke’ Law (1-dimensional): $$ F \tiny x \normalsize =-kx $$
	Elastic potential energy of a spring (derive by substituting spring force into definition of work for a variable force): $$ U \tiny elastic \normalsize = \frac 12 kx^2 $$
	Definition of mechanical energy: $$ E \tiny mech \normalsize = KE + U $$
	Work-energy theorem taking into account nonconservative forces: $$ KE\tiny i \normalsize + U\tiny i \normalsize + W\tiny nonconservative \normalsize = KE\tiny f \normalsize + U\tiny f$$
	What changes the total mechanical energy of a system? $$ W\tiny nonconservative \normalsize = \Delta E\tiny mech $$
	Definition of average power: $$ P\tiny avg \normalsize = \frac {W}{\Delta t} $$
	Instantaneous power: $$ P = F • \frac {dr}{dt} = F•v $$
	**IMPORTANT FOR POTENTIAL ENERGY FUNCTIONS U(x)**
	Relationship between force and potential energy in linear motion: $$ F\tiny x \normalsize = -\frac {dU}{dx} $$
