### Power
 * ==Power== is the rate at which work gets done (or energy gets transferred). The formula for power is:
 * $$P = \frac{W}{t}$$
 * Since power is a rate it can also be expressed as a derivative: $$P = \frac{dW}{dt}$$
 * Since the formula for Work equals: $$W = F•r$$ we can sub W into the equation for power: $$P = \frac{F•r}{t}$$ and since r/t is equal to displacement over time we can rewrite it to be velocity, resulting in: $$P = F•v$$
