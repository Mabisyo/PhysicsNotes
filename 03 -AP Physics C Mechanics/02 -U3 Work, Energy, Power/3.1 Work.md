## Definitions
* ==Work==: A way to transfer energy from one system to another.
	* Work is a force applied over a distance, when the distance traveled is perpendicular to the applied force or is equal to 0 the work done is 0.
	* $$D\tiny istance \normalsize \perp F\tiny orce\normalsize = 0$$
	* $$W= \intop F â€¢ dr$$
	* The force in consideration is denotated by *F*, and *dr* represents an infinitesimaly small displacement.
	* If the force is constant, it may be removed from the integral to result in: $$W=F\intop dr$$ which can be simplified using the **==DOT product==** to be: $$W = (Fcos\theta)r$$
		* Note that Work is the result of a DOT product multiplication so it is a *scalar* quantity. Another result of the DOT product is that only the component of force that is parallel to the displacement does any work.
		* Any component of a force that is perpendicular to the direction that an object moves cannot do work because the displacement in that direction is zero.
