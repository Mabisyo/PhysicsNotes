## Work-Energy Theorem
* ==Work-Energy Theorem:== Work is the change in an object's kinetic energy due to the action of a given force. The formula for the Work-Energy Theorem is:$$W \tiny total\normalsize = \Delta K$$
	* Just like work, kinetic energy is a scalar quantity.
	* Proof: $$ W=F • dr $$ $$ W=ma•dr=m(a\tiny x\normalsize dx \space+\space a\tiny y\normalsize dy) $$$$ W=m()$$
