## Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem
* ==Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem:== Work is the change in an object's kinetic energy due to the action of a given force. The formula for the Work-Kinetic Energy Theorem is:$$W \tiny total\normalsize = \Delta K$$
	* Just like work, kinetic energy is a scalar quantity.
	* Proof (it’s based in two dimensions, but it can be extended to three by adding a *z* component): 
		Definition of work –>$$ dW=F • dr $$Apply Newton’s 2nd Law and split a•dr into the *x* and *y* components –> $$ dW=ma•dr=m(a\tiny x\normalsize dx \space+\space a\tiny y\normalsize dy) $$Substitute the definition of acceleration and commute the differentials –>$$ dW=m(\frac {dv\tiny x}{dt}dx \space+\space \frac {dv\tiny y}{dt}dy)=m(\frac {dx}{dt}dv\tiny x \normalsize \space+\space \frac{dy}{dt}dv\tiny y \normalsize)$$ Substitute the definition of velocity –>$$ dW=m(v\tiny x \normalsize \space dv\tiny x \normalsize \space+\space v\tiny y \normalsize \space dv\tiny y \normalsize) $$ Integrate and distribute the integral within the parentheses –>
		$$ \int dW=\int m(v\tiny x \normalsize \space dv\tiny x \normalsize \space+\space v\tiny y \normalsize \space dv\tiny y \normalsize)= m(\int v\tiny x \normalsize \space dv\tiny x \normalsize \space+\space \int v\tiny y \normalsize \space dv\tiny y \normalsize) $$
		Evaluate the integrals and for the right side, evaluate from the initial velocity to the final velocity since we integrated with respect to a changing velocity –>$$ W=m[\frac 12 v \tiny x \normalsize^2 + \frac 12 v \tiny y \normalsize^2] \tiny vi \normalsize ^{vf} $$ Factor out the 1/2 and plug in the bounds of integration –> $$ W=\frac 12m[(v \tiny xf \normalsize ^2 \space+\space v \tiny yf \normalsize ^2)-(v \tiny xi \normalsize ^2 \space+\space v \tiny yi \normalsize ^2)] $$ Apply the Pythagorean theorem for the components of two-dimensional velocity and distribute the m/2 –>$$ W=\frac 12m(v \tiny f \normalsize ^2 - v \tiny i \normalsize ^2)=\frac 12mv \tiny f \normalsize ^2 \space-\space \frac 12mv \tiny i \normalsize ^2 $$ On the right side are the mathematical definitions of the final and initial kinetic energies, and the difference between them is the change in kinetic energy –>$$ W=KE \tiny f \normalsize \space- KE \tiny i \normalsize = ∆KE $$

**Practice Problems**
1) A mass *m* is pulled a distance *d* up an incline  (angle of elevation *θ*) at a constant speed using a rope that is parallel to the incline. The coefficient of kinetic friction is *μ*.
	(a) What is the magnitude of the tension force in the rope? The normal force?
	(b) What is the work done by the normal force? Kinetic friction? The tension force? What is the net work?
	(c) What is the change in the total mechanical energy? Show that this is equal to the  work performed by nonconservative forces. In other words, prove that this scenario adheres to the principle: $$ \Delta E\tiny mech \normalsize = W\tiny nonconservative $$
2) A mass *m* attached to a string of length 2*r* swings, starting at rest when the string is horizontal, until the string is vertical. At the instant the string is vertical, the mass makes contact with a horizontal surface, the string is cut, and the mass continues along a frictionless track as shown in the below image.

	(b) Sketch the forces acting on the mass when it is in the position shown in the above image.
	(c) Find the object’s speed and centripetal force as functions of *θ*. 
	(d) Determine at what angle *θ* the mass will fall off the track.
