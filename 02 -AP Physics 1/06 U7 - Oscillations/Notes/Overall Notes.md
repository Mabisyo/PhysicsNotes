Oscillatory motion is a central topic in classical mechanics that deals with systems moving back and forth about an equilibrium position. Understanding oscillations not only helps with AP Physics 1 but also lays the groundwork for studying engineering systems, acoustics, electronics, and even quantum mechanics.

## 1. Overview & Key Concepts

- **Oscillatory Motion:** Periodic motion around an equilibrium point.
    
- **Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM):** Idealized motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and opposes the displacement.
    
- **Key Terms:**
    
    - **Amplitude (A):** The maximum displacement from equilibrium.
        
    - **Period (T):** The time for one complete cycle.
        
    - **Frequency (f):** The number of cycles per unit time; $f = \frac{1}{T}$​.
        
    - **Angular Frequency (ω):** Related to frequency by $ω=2πf$.
        
    - **Phase Constant (ϕ):** Determines the initial state of motion.
        

## 2. Fundamental Equations & Derivations

### 2.1. The SHM Differential Equation

For a mass-spring system governed by Hooke’s Law ( **if you apply a force to a spring, then the force stretches spring**. And if you don't stretch too much, Hooke's law says that the amount of force you apply is proportional to the stretch. So, that means that if you apply twice the force, you get twice the stretch. ):

$F=−kx$

Newton’s second law gives:

$m\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -kx \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \frac{k}{m}x = 0$

Defining the angular frequency as:

$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}​​$

The equation becomes:

$\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0$

### 2.2. General Solution to SHM

The general solution to the above differential equation is:

$x(t)=Acos⁡(ωt+ϕ)$

Where:

- A is the amplitude.
    
- ϕ is the phase shift.
    

### 2.3. Derivation of the Period

From the relation:

$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$​

Substitute ω:

$\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \frac{2\pi}{T} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$

### 2.4. Energy in SHM

Total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies:

$E = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mx^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

At maximum displacement, all energy is potential; at equilibrium, it is kinetic.

## 3. Additional Topics in Oscillations

- **Damped Oscillations:** Introduce a damping force (e.g., friction or air resistance) typically modeled by $F_d = -b\dot{x}$. The differential equation becomes:
    
    $m\ddot{x} + b\dot{x} + kx = 0$
    
    The solution shows an exponential decay in amplitude.
    
- **Forced Oscillations & Resonance:** With an external periodic force $F(t) = F_0 \cos(\omega_{drive} t)$, the equation is:
    
    $m\ddot{x} + b\dot{x} + kx = F_0 \cos(\omega_{drive} t)$
    
    At the resonance frequency (when $\omega_{drive}$​ is near the natural frequency $\omega_0)$, the amplitude is maximized.
