		 *==Linear Momentum== ==(p)== is the product of an objects mass and velocity.


Can be directly expressed as: $p = mv$                    In terms of Newtons Second Law: $F =$ $\Delta p$

Over a change of time, $\Delta t$ , the expression can be written as: $F = ma$
	-----------------------------------Derivation:
	-----------------------------------—-$p = mv$
	---------------–----–------–---------––-=
	-------------$F =$ $\Delta p$ / $\Delta t$  ← $\Delta p$ / $\Delta t$  = $\Delta mv$ / $\Delta t$  → $a =$ $\Delta v$ / $\Delta t$
	-------------------------–------–---–-—=
	------------------------------------–-$F = ma$


EXAMPLE: 
Givens → m = .05kg, t = 1ms, v = 70m/s
Solve for Force:
	 F = ma
	 F = m(v/t)
	 F = (.05kg)(.001ms/70ms)
	 F = (.05kg)(70000)
	 F = 3500N


*==Impulse== ==(I)== is the change in linear momentum over time.

Can be directly expressed as: $J = F \Delta t$

In terms of Newtons Second Law: $J = \Delta p$
	Derivation
	$J = F \Delta t$
	$J = (\Delta p / \Delta t) \bullet \Delta t$
	$J = (\Delta p \bullet \Delta t) / \Delta t \rightarrow \Delta p \bullet (\Delta t / \Delta t)$ 
	$J = \Delta p$ or $J = \Delta m \bullet \Delta v$

In equation form: $P_f = P_i + J$

The area under an F vs T graph is equal to the impulse.

EXAMPLE:
Givens $\rightarrow$ m = 0.5 kg, $v_i$ = 0 m/s, $v_f$ = 30 m/s, t = 8 ms
Find impulse and average force:
	Impulse: $J = \Delta p$
	$J = \Delta p_e - \Delta p_i$
	$J = \Delta mv_f - \Delta mv_i$
	$J = \Delta (0.5 kg)(30 m/s) - \Delta (0.5 kg)(0 m/s)$
	$J = 15 kg \bullet m/s - 0$
	$J = 15 kg \bullet m/s$

EXAMPLE:
An 80kg stuntman jumps out a window that is 45m above ground.
- a) How fast is he falling when he reaches ground level?
- b) He lands on a large, air-filled target coming to rest in 1.5s. What average force does he feel when coming to rest?
- c) What if he had instead landed on the ground? (impact time = 10 m/s)
Givens $\rightarrow$ m = 80 kg, h = 45 m
a) (hint: you need an energy equation)
	$mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
	$(2) \bullet mgh = (2) \bullet \frac{1}{2}mv^2$
	$2mgh = mv^2$
	$2mgh / m = mv^2 / m$
	$2gh = v^2$
	$\sqrt {2gh} = \sqrt{v^2}$
	$v = \sqrt {2gh}$
	$v = \sqrt {2(9.8 m/s^2)(45 m)}$
	$v = \sqrt {882}$
	$v = 29.7 m/s \rightarrow 30 m/s$
b)
	$J = F \Delta t$
	$J / \Delta t = F \Delta t / \Delta t$
	$F = J / \Delta t$
	$F = (p_f - p_i) / \Delta t$
	$F = (mv_f - mv_i) / \Delta t$
	$F = ((80 kg)(30 m/s) - (80 kg)(0 m/s)) / (1.5s)$
	$F = 2400 \frac {N}{s} / (1.5s)$
	$F = 1600N$$
c)
	$J = F \Delta t$
	$J / \Delta t = F \Delta t / \Delta t$
	$F = J / \Delta t$
	$F = (p_f - p_i) / \Delta t$
	$F = (mv_f - mv_i) / \Delta t$
	$F = ((80 kg)(30 m/s) - (80 kg)(0 m/s)) / (0.01s)$
	$F = 2400 \frac {N}{s} / (0.01s)$
	$F = 240,000N$$

EXAMPLE:
A small block of mass m = 0.07 kg, initially at rest, is struck by an impulsive force F of duration 10 m/s whose strength varies with time according to the following graph:
	Insert graph here
What is the resulting speed of the block?
Givens $\rightarrow$ m = 0.07 kg, v = 10 m/s
Solve for velocity:
	J = area under F vs t  graph (trapezoid shape)
	$J = \frac{1}{2} (b_1 + b_2) \bullet h$

### **Final page**

### **Conservation of Linear Momentum**

The Law of Conservation of Momentum: The momentum “before/initially” equals the momentum afterwards.

Can be expressed as:

∑Pinitial=∑Pfinal\sum p_{initial} = \sum p_{final}∑Pinitial​=∑Pfinal​

Two interacting objects experience equal but opposite momentum changes (assuming no external forces).

### **Collisions**

Collisions are systems.

When two objects collide, they can have:

---

**Elastic Collisions**

- Objects bounce off each other in equal and opposite directions.
    

m1v1+m2v2=m1v3+m2v4m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = m_1 v_3 + m_2 v_4m1​v1​+m2​v2​=m1​v3​+m2​v4​

---

**Inelastic Collisions**

- Kinetic energy is lost but momentum is conserved.
    

m1v1+m2v2=m1v3+m2v4m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = m_1 v_3 + m_2 v_4m1​v1​+m2​v2​=m1​v3​+m2​v4​

**Perfectly Inelastic Collisions**

- Greatest kinetic energy is lost.
    
- Momentum is conserved.
    

m1v1+m2v2=(m1+m2)v3m_1 v_1 + m_2 v_2 = (m_1 + m_2) v_3m1​v1​+m2​v2​=(m1​+m2​)v3​
