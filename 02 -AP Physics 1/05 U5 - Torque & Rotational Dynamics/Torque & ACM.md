## Definitions
- ==Torque==: Rotational equivalent of force. It measures the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis.
	- Since it is a force, is causes objects to accelerate. It specifically changes an object's angular velocity, similar to how a net force changes an object's linear velocity. Torque is calculated by multiplying the perpendicular force applied to an object by the distance between the force and the axis of rotation (radius). 
	- The net torque on an object is equal to its angular acceleration multiplied by its moment of inertia. 
	- **Moment of Inertia**: relates to the mass and depends on how that mass is distributed. The farther away the mass is from the axis of rotation, the higher the object's moment of inertia. 
	- Measured in newton-meters (Nm)
	- Direction: Torque is a vector quantity (Ref. Right hand rule)
- ==Angular Displacement==: The angle through which an object rotates (radians)
- ==Angular Velocity==: Rate of change of angular displacement (m/s)
- ==Angular Acceleration==: Rate of change of angular velocity 
- ==Cross Product==: The cross product of two vectors results in a vector perpendicular to both
# Equations

## Angular Velocity
$$
	\omega = \omega_0+\alpha t
$$
## Change in Angular Position
$$
	\theta = \theta_0+\omega_0t+\frac{1}{2}\alpha t^2
$$
## Final Angular Velocity 
$$
	\omega^2 = \omega^2_0 + 2\alpha(\theta-\theta_0)
$$
### Torque
$$
	\tau = r * F = rFsin\theta
$$
	- r: Distance from the pivot point to the point of force application (lever arm)
	- F: Applied force
	- Î¸: Angle between the force vector and the lever arm
#### Magnitude of Torque
$$
	\tau = r_\perp F
$$
- Tau is the magnitude of the torque produced by a force exerted on an extended object
- *F* is the magnitude of the force 
- *r* is the Lever arm:
	- perpendicular distance from the rotation axis of the extended object to the line of action of the force
#### Net Torque
$$
	\sum \tau\tiny ext\normalsize = I\alpha_z 
$$
$$
	\sum \tau = (\sum mr^2)\alpha
$$
- The *net torque*, or sum of all external torques exerted on a rigid body for the axis about which it can rotate
- Alpha: The angular acceleration produced by the net torque (for dir. use RHR)
- *I*: The object's rotational inertia for the axis about which it can rotate
## Vector Multiplication
$$
	A \times B = |A||B|sin\theta n
$$
- *n*: Unit vector perpendicular to the plane of *A* and *B*.
### Tangential Acceleration
$$
	a_t = \alpha r
$$
- Acceleration along the tangent of the circular path, caused by a change in speed.
- Alpha: Angular acceleration (rads per second square)
## Rotational Inertia
- For an object of mass *m* rotating at a distance r from a fixed axis
$$
	I=mr^2
$$
### Moments of Inertia: Thin walled hollow cylinder/hoop
$$
	I = MR^2
$$
### Moments of Inertia: Solid Cylinder or Disk
$$
	I=\frac{1}{2}MR^2
$$
