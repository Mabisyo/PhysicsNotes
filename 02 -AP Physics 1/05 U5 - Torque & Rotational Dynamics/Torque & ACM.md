## Definitions
- ==Torque==: rotational equivalent of force. It measures the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis.
	- Since it is a force, is causes objects to accelerate. It specifically changes an object's angular velocity, similar to how a net force changes an object's linear velocity. Torque is calculated by multiplying the perpendicular force applied to an object by the distance between the force and the axis of rotation (radius). 
	- The net torque on an object is equal to its angular acceleration multiplied by its moment of inertia. 
	- **Moment of Inertia**: relates to the mass and depends on how that mass is distributed. The farther away the mass is from the axis of rotation, the higher the object's moment of inertia. 
	- Measured in newton-meters (Nm)
	- Direction: Torque is a vector quantity (Ref. Right hand rule)
- ==Angular Displacement==: The angle through which an object rotates (radians)
- ==Angular Velocity==: Rate of change of angular displacement (m/s)
- ==Angular Acceleration==: Rate of change of angular velocity 
# Equations
### Torque
$$
	\tau = r * F = rFsin\theta
$$
	- r: Distance from the pivot point to the point of force application (lever arm)
	- F: Applied force
	- Î¸: Angle between the force vector and the lever arm
### Tangential Acceleration
$$
	a_t = \alpha r
$$
- Acceleration along the tangent of the circular path, caused by a change in speed.
- Alpha: Angular acceleration (rads per second square)
