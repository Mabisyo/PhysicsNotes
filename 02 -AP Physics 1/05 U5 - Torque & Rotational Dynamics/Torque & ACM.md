## Definitions
- ==Torque==: rotational equivalent of force. It measures the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis.
	- Measured in newton-meters (Nm)
	- Direction: Torque is a vector quantity (Ref. Right hand rule)
- ==Angular Displacement==: The angle through which an object rotates (radians)
- ==Angular Velocity==: Rate of change of angular displacement (m/s)
- ==Angular Acceleration==: Rate of change of angular velocity 
# Equations
### Torque
$$
	\tau = r*F*sin\theta
$$
	- r: Distance from the pivot point to the point of force application (lever arm)
	- F: Applied force
	- Î¸: Angle between the force vector and the lever arm
