- One needs to make a distinction between distance traveled and displacement. In general, the displacement or net change in position of an object may not be equal to the total distance traveled by the object. The only exception to this rule is if the object travels in a straight line and never changes direction. 
- Average speed is not necessarily equal to the magnitude of the average velocity. The only exception is when the distance is equal to the displacement
- The signs indicate direction, not amount or rate.

***Free Fall Specific Concepts***
- **Law of Falling Bodies**: In a vacuum, all bodies will fall with a constant acceleration regardless of how massive they are
- Heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects in the presence of air, due to the effects of **air resistance** having a more adverse effect on lighter objects than heavier objects. The constant acceleration of gravity has nothing to do with heavier objects falling faster than lighter ones.
## ==Constant Velocity==:
Movement at the same rate over a time interval. Direction and speed must be the same throughout this time interval
- Velocity tells us how quickly the position changes
## ==Instantaneous Velocity==:
Velocity at a single point during an object's motion. Must be approximated in AP Physics without Calculus 
### Formula for Instantaneous velocity for linear motion
$$
	v ≈ \frac{∆x}{∆t}
$$
## ==Average velocity==:
*A vector quantity*; Can be identified as the displacement of an object divided by the **time interval** for the object to undergo that displacement.
### *Average velocity for linear motion* (**Consider Direction**)

$$
V_a = \frac{x_2 - x_1}{t_2 - t_1}
$$
## ==Speed==: 
*Scalar quantity*; The distance traveled divided by the time it took to move that distance. Disregard direction. 
- Instantaneous speed is always equal to the magnitude of instantaneous velocity
### Formula for Speed for Linear Motion

$$
	s = \frac{d}{t}
$$
### Other Formulas (For Distance & Time) 
$$
	d = st
$$
$$
	t = \frac{d}{s}
$$
## ==Average Speed==:
*Scalar quantity*; The distance traveled of a time interval divided by that time interval 
### Formula for Average Speed for Linear Motion (**Disregard Direction**)

$$
	s_a = \frac{∆d}{∆t}
$$
## ==Acceleration==
*Vector Quantity*; Tells us how quickly velocity changes
- **Remember**: Deceleration and Negative Acceleration are two different things. Deceleration means that the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity, the speed, is decreasing. Negative acceleration simply means that the object's velocity is changing in the negative direction. 
*Free Fall*
- The acceleration due to the force of gravity always points downwards. 
- The effects of air resistance will be ignored when solving problems for free fall
### Formula for Acceleration
$$
	a = \frac{∆v}{∆t} = \frac{v_f - v_i}{t_f-t_i}
$$
### Formula for the Acceleration of Gravity
$$
	a_g = -9.81\frac{m}{s^2}
$$
# Kinematic Equations
*Use each equation as fit for the problems. Adjust variables for the context of the problems (i.e. free fall, horizontal motion*)
$$
	x = \frac{1}{2}(v_i+v_f)t
	
$$
$$
	v_x=v_i+a_xt
$$
$$
	x = x_i+v_it+\frac{1}{2}a_xt^2

$$
$$
	v_x^2 = v_i^2+2a_x(x-x_i)
$$

## Questions to Practice 
==Horizontal Motion==:
	A car is traveling on a straight, horizontal road at a constant velocity of 20 m/s. The driver suddenly sees a barrier 60 meters ahead and immediately applies the brakes, causing the car to decelerate at a rate of  4 m/s^2
		1) How much time will it take for the car to come to a stop?
		2) Will the car stop before hitting the barrier?
		3) If the car does not stop in time, what will be its velocity when it hits the barrier
==Free Fall Motion==:
	A rock is dropped from the top of a 45 meter tall cliff. Assume there is no air resistance
		1) How long will it take for the rock to reach the ground?
		2) What will the velocity of the rock be just before it hits the ground?
		3) If another rock is thrown downward from the same height with an initial velocity of 5 m/s, how long will it take for it to reach the ground
