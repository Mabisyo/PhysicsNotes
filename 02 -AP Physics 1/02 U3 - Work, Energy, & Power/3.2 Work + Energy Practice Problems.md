4. A 3.0 kg block is moving at 2.0 m/s on a rough horizontal surface when a force of 5.0 N is applied in the direction of motion. The block moves 4.0 m before coming to rest.
	i. Calculate the initial kinetic energy of the block
	ii. Determine the work done by the applied force
	iii. Calculate the work done by friction
	iv. Find the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the surface
5. A 10.0 kg cart is pushed with a varying force along a straight horizontal path. The force applied increases linearly from 0 N to 40 N over a distance of 5.0 m.
	i. Determine the work done on the cart by the applied force
	ii. If the cart started from rest, determine its final speed after traveling the 5.0m
	iii. Suppose friction is present and does -50 J of work. What is the new final speed of the cart?
