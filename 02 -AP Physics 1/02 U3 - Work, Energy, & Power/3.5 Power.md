==***Power***== is the rate at which work is done, meaning that it qualifies how quickly energy is transferred or transformed.
- Power is directly proportional to the amount of work done and inversely proportional to the time it takes to do that work. If the same amount of work is done in a shorter amount of time, more power is delivered. 
- Units of Power: The Joule per Second, also known as the watt (W). $$\frac{Nm}{s} $$
- Power is a scalar (since work and time are scalars)
## Average Power v. Instantaneous Power
***Average Power*** is the total work done over a specific time interval.
***Instantaneous Power*** refers to the power output of a force at a specific moment in time. 
- If the power output is constant, then the average power will equal the instantaneous power. 
# Equations

## Power
$$
	P = \frac{W}{t}
$$
- *P*: Power (Watts)
- *W*: Work (Joules)
- *t*: Time (seconds)
### Power in terms of Force & Velocity
$$
	P = Fvcos(\theta)
$$
~ *Where v is velocity and theta is the angle between force and velocity vectors*
### Power in Rotational Motion
$$
	P = \tau \omega
$$
where tau is torque and omega is the angular velocity
