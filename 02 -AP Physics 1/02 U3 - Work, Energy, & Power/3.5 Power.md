==***Power***== is the rate at which work is done, meaning that it qualifies how quickly energy is transferred or transformed.
- Power is directly proportional to the amount of work done and inversely proportional to the time it takes to do that work. If the same amount of work is done in a shorter amount of time, more power is delivered. 
- Units of Power: The Joule per Second, also known as the watt (W). $$\frac{Nm}{s} $$
- Power is a scalar (since work and time are scalars)
## Average Power v. Instantaneous Power
***Average Power*** is the total work done over a specific
