## Work:
==Work== is a mechanism for energy transfer/transformation and is done when a force causes the displacement of an object. 
- Measured in Joules (Scalar; Units: Newton-Meters)
- Work is positive when the force has a component in the direction of displacement (Angle < 90 degrees). This means that a form of energy is added to the object or system.
- Work is negative when the force opposes displacement (Angle > 90 degrees). This means that a form of energy is being removed from the object or system.
- Work is zero when the force is perpendicular to the displacement (Angle  = 90 degrees). This means that no energy is being transferred or transformed, neither added or subtracted.

## Transfer of Energy
$$
	K \leftharpoonup \rightharpoondown P
$$
*Work is the transfer/transformation of Energy*
## Work Equation
$$
	W = Fdcos(\theta) = F\Delta xcos(\theta)
$$
- *W*: Work (Joules)
- *F*: Force (Newtons)
- *d*: Displacement
- *Theta*: Angle between the force and displacement vectors
## Net Work
$$
	W^1 + W^2 + W... = W^N
$$
- Net Work is equal to the sum of individual works exerted on the objects
$$
	W^N=\Delta K
$$
# Energy - Concepts & Definitions

## Energy
==Energy== is the capacity to do work. It exists in various forms, such as kinetic, potential, and mechanical energy. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed. 
==Kinetic Energy==:
- Kinetic energy is a form of energy that an object or a particle has by reason of its motion.
==Potential Energy==: 
- Potential energy is stored energy that depends on the relative position of various parts of a system. In order for energy to be potential it must be able to be stored and retrievable. 
==Types of Energy==: 
- Mechanical Energy
- Nuclear Energy (Stored in the nucleus)
- Electric/Magnetic Energy
- Chemical Energy (stored in mainly bonds)
- Thermal Energy (temperature & heat) - associated with random motion; not potential. 
- Sound Energy
## Conservation of Mechanical Energy 
- Principle: In the absence of non-conservative forces (i.e. friction), the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant.
$$
	E \tiny mech \normalsize = KE + PE = constant
$$
*Example*: A roller coaster at the top of a hill has a maximum PE and a minimum KE. As it descends, PE converts to KE, but mechanical energy remains constant. 
# Energy - Equations

## Kinetic Energy (KE)
*Energy of Motion* 
$$
	KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
- *m*: Mass (kg)
- *v*: Velocity (m/s)
## Potential Energy (PE) - **Gravitational**
$$
	U_g=mg*y
$$
- *m*: mass (kg)
- *y*: Height (m)
- *g*: Acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2) - always perpendicular to the direction of motion, so forces in the y direction do no work

## Work-Energy Theorem
$$
	W_N=\Delta KE = KE_f-KE_i
$$
## Derivation for Work-Energy Theorem
1. Start with Newton's Second Law: $$F\tiny net \normalsize = ma$$
2. Use Kinematic Equation: $$v^2_f = v^2_i+2a(\Delta x)$$
3. Rearrange to solve for acceleration times distance: $$a\Delta x=\frac{v^2_f-v^2_i}{2}$$
4. Substitute into work equation: $$W\tiny net \normalsize = F\tiny net \normalsize * \Delta x = ma *\Delta x = m(\frac{v^2_f-v^2_i}{2})$$
5. Simplify: $$W \tiny net \normalsize = \frac{1}{2}mv^2_f-\frac{1}{2}mv^2_i=\Delta KE$$
## Derivation for Gravitational Potential Energy
1. Start with work done against gravity: $$W = F*\Delta x = mg*\Delta x$$
2. Since work done equals change in Potential Energy: $$PE\tiny grav \normalsize = mgy$$
## Vector mathematics in Work & Energy
==Dot Product==: Work involves the dot product of force and displacement vectors
$$
	W = |\vec{F_i}|\vec{\Delta x}|cos(\theta)
$$
- The dot product yields a scalar value
- Use vector components to simplify calculations $$ W = F_xd_x+F_yd_y+F_zd_z$$

## Problems
1. A 5kg object is lifted vertically by a force of 60N. If the object is displace by 10m, calculate the work done
2. A roller coaster car of mass 500 kg starts from rest at a height of 40m. Calculate its speed at the bottom of the hill, assuming no energy losses.
