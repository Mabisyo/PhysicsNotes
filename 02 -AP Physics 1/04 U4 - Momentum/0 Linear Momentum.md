## Definition of Linear Momentum
- ***Linear Momentum*** is a vector quantity defined as the product of an object's mass and the object's velocity.
## Impulse & Change in Momentum
- ***Impulse*** is defined as the change in momentum of an object
	- It is also equal to the net force acting on an object multiplied by the time interval over which the force acts.
	- The increase in momentum of an object is related to the area under the force - time graph
- A longer stopping time during an impact reduces the force applied for the same change in momentum. this is the principle behind safety features like air mattresses and air bags in cars. 
## Conservation of Linear Momentum
- In the absence of external forces, the total linear momentum of a system of objects remains constant
- For Two colliding objects, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision
- In an explosion, where an object breaks into multiple pieces, the total momentum of the fragments immediately after the explosion is equal to the initial momentum of the object. 
## Types of Collisions
### Elastic Collision
- A collision in which the total kinetic energy of the system is conserved. *Momentum is always conserved in collisions, regardless of whether they are elastic or inelastic*. The two objects cannot be touching each other and typically only happens with the collision of two protons.
### Inelastic Collision
- A collision in which the total kinetic energy of the system is not conserved. Some kinetic energy is converted into non-mechanical energy forms. The objects will touch each other in this collision.
### Perfectly Inelastic Collision
- A type of inelastic collision in which the colliding objects stick together after the collision. In such collisions, the maximum possible kinetic energy is lost while still conserving momentum. 
### Explosion
- The opposite of a perfectly inelastic collision, in which a single object fractures and sends fragments in many directions. 
## Momentum and Kinetic Energy 
- Objects can have the same momentum but different kinetic energies if they have different masses or speeds. For a given momentum, an object with a smaller mass will have a greater kinetic energy. 
- If two objects have the same kinetic energy, the one with the greater mass will have the greater momentum 
## External Forces and Momentum of a System
- An external force acting on a system will change the total momentum of the system. 
- For a single object, a net force causes a change in its momentum over time. 
## Average Force
- The ***Impulse - Momentum Theorem*** can be used to find the average force during a collision or impact. A longer collision time results in a smaller average force for the same momentum change. \
