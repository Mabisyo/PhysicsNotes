U2- Dynamics

ac= centripetal acceleration
Fc = centripetal force
T = orbital period
f = frequency
V = tangential velocity
r = radius
w <- omega = angular velocity
g = acceleration due to gravity
m = mass of small object
M = mass of big object
Muk = coefficient of friction kin
Mus = coefficient of friction stat
G = newton's gravitational constant
L = length of string (con. pend.)
Fn = normal force
fs = general static friction force
S = arclength





    UCM & Gravitation:

  - ac = (V^2)/r
  - ac = (w^2)r
 -  Fc = (mV^2)/r
  - Fc = m(w^2)r
 -  T = 1/f

  - v = (2rpi)/T
   -w = (2pi)/T

   Conic pendulum scenario:
   Fc = mgtan(theta)
   V = sqrt(gLsin(theta)tan(theta))

   Turning airplane scenario:
   Fc = mgtan(theta)
   V = sqrt(grtan(theta))

   Turning on a flat curve w friction:
   
    Fc = (Mus)mg
    V = sqrt(gr(Mus))

   Turning on a banked curve w friction:

    Fc = Fn(sin(theta)) + fs(cos(theta))


         mg(sin(theta) + Muscos(theta))
    Fc =  ---------------------------
          cos(theta) - Mussin(theta)

    
           rg(sin(theta) + Mus(cos(theta)))
    V^2 =  -------------------------------
            cos(theta) - (Mus)sin(theta)

NOTE: SQUARE ROOT EXPRESSION ABOVE FOR V

 v = rw
 a = ra
 S = r(deltatheta)

                       Forces:
-1st Newton Law: An object at rest remains at 
rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted 
upon by a net ext. force
 
(!) AKA Inertia: an object's resistance to a 
change in motion

-2nd Newton Law: 
	F = ma --> a = F/m
Force and acceleration are directly prop.
Mass and acceleration are inversely prop.

-3rd Newton Law: "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction" 
	F1on2 = -F2on1

Net Force:
	F = ma
	sigmaFx = F1x + F2x...
	sigmaFy = F1y + F2y...

Friction:
* Fk < Fs < Fsmax always
Fs </= Fsmax
Fsmax = MusFn

fk = MukFn

Weight:

Fg = mg 

*to split forces into components: SOHCAHTOA

Inclined Planes:

Fn = mgcos(theta) *Fn is always the force perpendicular to the surface
			equal in magn. to the perpen. vector of Fg.

Fg = mgsin(theta) *horizontal vector (object wants to travel down the incline) 

Fg = mgcos(theta) *vertical vector (object pushes into the incline; creates Fn)

fk = MukFn = Mukmgcos(theta)

Pulleys:

Ideal Pulley - frictionless, massless, and does not accelerate

*use the "weird axis" which travels along the string or rope:

> create a coord. system for each object making the (+) direction
	the direction of the presumed motion
> then, write the equation for acceleration for each object and 
   add them together; internal parts should cancel out (tension);
> then, solve for acceleration
- accelerations of each object will be equal since they are bound
