## Rotational Kinetic Energy
- Rotational kinetic energy describes the energy of rotating objects. Understanding this concept, along with translational kinetic energy, helps explain how objects store energy through rotation and how to describe motion.
- It may be calculated using the formula:
	-$$K =\frac{1}{2}(I\omega^2)$$where K is kinetic energy, $I$ is rotational inertia, and $\omega$ is angular velocity. 
	- Rotational inertia $I$ depends on the objectâ€™s mass and its distribution relative to the rotation axis.
	- Angular velocity $\omega$ measures how quickly the object rotates in radians per second. 
### Rotational vs translational
- An object can have rotational kinetic energy without having translational kinetic energy and vice versa.
