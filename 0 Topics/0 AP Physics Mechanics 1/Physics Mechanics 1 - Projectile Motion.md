# Summary and Conceptual Breakdown
_______________
Projectile motion is the curved path that an object follows when launched into the air, influenced by gravity. It's analyzed by separating the motion into horizontal and vertical components, which are independent of each other, though they are linked by time. The horizontal motion has a constant velocity because there is no acceleration in the x direction. The vertical motion is affected by gravity, which causes a constant downward acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s². When a projectile is launched at an angle, its initial velocity has both horizontal and vertical components. The initial velocity must be broken down into these components to analyze the motion.

The key equations in projectile motion describe displacement, velocity, and time for both the horizontal and vertical motion. The horizontal displacement is simply the initial horizontal velocity multiplied by time. Vertical motion is described using equations that incorporate initial vertical velocity, time, and the acceleration due to gravity. The time of flight, maximum height, and range (horizontal distance traveled) can all be determined using these equations. When the projectile is launched at an angle from a height, the quadratic equation must be used to determine the time of flight. The maximum range is achieved when a projectile is launched at a 45-degree angle.

# General Equations for Projectile Motion
*These equations apply to projectile motion in general. They rely on the idea that motion in the x and y directions can be analyzed separately*
### Horizontal Displacement
- This equation calculates the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile. It is the initial horizontal velocity (v₀ₓ) multiplied by the time (t) the projectile has been in motion. There is no acceleration in the horizontal direction, so the velocity remains constant
$$
	Δx = v₀ₓ * t
$$
### Horizontal Velocity
- This shows that the horizontal velocity of the projectile remains constant throughout its flight because there is no acceleration in the horizontal direction
$$
	vₓ = v₀ₓ
$$
### Vertical Displacement
- This calculates the vertical displacement of the projectile, taking into account the initial vertical velocity (v₀y), the time in the air (t), and the acceleration due to gravity (g).
$$
	Δy = y_0+v₀y * t - (1/2)gt²
$$
### Vertical Velocity
- This equation calculates the vertical velocity of the projectile at any given time (t), considering the initial vertical velocity (v₀y) and the effect of gravity (g).
$$
	v_y = v₀y - gt
$$

### Horizontal Displacement
- This equation calculates the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile. It is the initial horizontal velocity (v₀ₓ) multiplied by the time (t) the projectile has been in motion. There is no acceleration in the horizontal direction, so the velocity remains constant
$$
	Δx = v₀ₓ * t
$$
### Time in the Air
- This equation calculates the time it takes for the projectile to reach the ground, where h is the initial height and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The time it takes for an object to fall vertically is the same, whether it is also moving horizontally or not
$$
	t = √\frac{2h}{g}
$$
### Final Vertical Velocity
- Treat this component as a free fall problem
$$
	v_y=-gt
$$
# Projectile Launched at an Angle
___________
==*These equations are used when a projectile is launched at an angle with respect to the horizontal axis. It requires breaking down the initial velocity into x and y components*==
__________
### Initial Horizontal Velocity
- This equation determines the initial horizontal component of the velocity vector, where v₀ is the initial velocity, and θ is the launch angle
$$
	v₀ₓ = v₀ * cos(θ)
$$
### Initial Vertical Velocity
- This equation determines the initial vertical component of the velocity vector, where v₀ is the initial velocity, and θ is the launch angle
$$
	v₀y = v₀ * sin(θ)
$$
### Time to Reach Maximum Height
- This equation calculates the time it takes for the projectile to reach its maximum height, where the vertical velocity momentarily becomes zero
$$
	t_m=\frac{v_0*sinθ}{g}
$$
### Maximum Height
- This equation gives the maximum vertical displacement of the projectile
$$
	Δy_m=\frac{v_o^2*sinθ}{2g}
$$
### Total Time in Air
- This equation calculates the total time the projectile is airborne, which is twice the time it takes to reach its maximum height, since the motion is symmetrical
$$
	t_f=\frac{2v_0sinθ}{g}
$$
### Range
- This equation calculates the horizontal distance the projectile travels before hitting the ground3. It is derived using the total time in the air and the horizontal velocity.
$$
	R = \frac{v_0^2sin2θ}{g}
$$
# Projectile Launched at an Angle from a Cliff 
_______________________
==*These equations take into account an initial height above the ground. The vertical motion must be calculated using the quadratic formula*==
______________
### Maximum Height
- This equation takes the same form as the equation for the vertical displacement of a projectile launched at an angle, but it calculates the maximum height of the projectile above the ground.
$$
	y_m=y₀ + (v₀y * t_m) - (\frac{1}{2})g * t_m²
$$
