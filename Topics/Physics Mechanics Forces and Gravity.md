# Concepts 
- ==Net Force==: The vector sum of all the external forces acting on an object or system
- ==Object==: Reduces the object down to a point
- ==System==: Maintains the integrity of the object and takes into consideration how parts interact with each other
- Classifications of forces:
	- Field forces *All Fundamental forces are field forces*
		- Masses - Gravitational Forces
		- Electric Charges - Electromagnetic Forces
		- Color Charges:
			- Strong Nuclear 
			- Weak Nuclear
- ==Internal and External Forces==
	- ==External Forces==: Any force that results from the interaction between the object (or the system) and its environment 
		- *Only external forces exerted on an object affect that object's acceleration*
	- ==Internal Forces==: Forces that originate in the object itself (or the system) they cannot change the object's velocity
### The Newton

## First Newton's Law
____________________
*An object at rest remains at rest, or if in motion, the object remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force*. Also known as Inertia, or an object's resistance to a change in motion.
- ==Note==: What determines how an object moves is the vector sum of all the forces exerted on that object or *Net Force*.

## Second Newton's Law
____________________
*The Force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration.*
- The larger the force applied, the greater the acceleration.
- **Force and Acceleration are directly proportional:** the greater the force applied, the greater the acceleration.
- **Mass and Acceleration are inversely proportional**: A larger mass requires a greater force to achieve the same acceleration
- **Vector Quantity**: Both force and acceleration are vector quantities, meaning they both have magnitude and direction. 
$$
	a = \frac{F^N}{m}
$$
$$
	F = ma
$$
*Acceleration equals net force over mass*
## Third Newton's Law
______________

$$
	F_a=-F_r(t_a-t_r)
$$

## Mass
*Manifestation of an object's inertia (Classical Mechanics)*
	The amount of matter inside an object or system, which is a scalar quantity and measured in kilograms. It measures the resistance of an object (or system) to changes in its motion due to a New-force. It is the quantitative measure of the inertia of the object. It is inversely proportional to acceleration.
		Mass is independent from gravity, while weight is dependent on gravity. An object's mass is the same no matter where the object is.

### *Friction* (Parallel to the surfaces in contact, opposition to the motion
_________________________________
### Concepts
- The static friction force is parallel to the surfaces in contact
- You can overcome static friction by pushing against it with sufficient force. this says that in a given situation, the static friction force has a maximum magnitude max static friction. 
- The value of static friction max depends on how hard the two surfaces are pushed together, that is, on the normal force that is exerted perpendicular to the two surfaces. The greater the magnitude of the normal force one surface exerts on the other, the greater the maximum static friction force exerted by the surface and the more difficult it is to make the surfaces slide past each other. 
- The force of static friction depends on the properties of the surfaces in contact.
- Static Friction is described by an inequality, not an equality
### Drag Coefficient (μ)
- The quantity μ is called the coefficient of friction (keep in mind that friction is a drag force). Its value is dependent on the properties of both surfaces in contact; for example μ_s has different values for steel on steel, for steel on glass, and for glass on glass. μ is dimensionless since it is calculated using units of force. 
- Typical values of the coefficient of static friction are between about 0.1 and 0.8
### Laws of Dry Friction
*Friction depends on the weight of an object on a surface, and that there is a coefficient that depends on the material*
- **First Law**: The friction force is proportional to the normal force. If the weight doubles, the friction force doubles.
- **Second Law**: The friction force is independent of the contact area. Two objects with the same weight will experience the same friction, even if their contact areas are different. This is due to surface roughness, which means that the actual contact area may be smaller than the observed area. 
- **Third Law**: For dry friction, the friction force is independent of the velocity of the object. This is different from air resistance, where friction increases with speed. 
- **Static vs. Kinetic Friction**: 
	- Static Friction: The force resisting initial motion
	- Kinetic Friction: The force opposing motion once the object is sliding 

| Kinetic Friction | Pull, surface, opp motion                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Static Friction  | Pull, surface, opposition to attempt motion |
