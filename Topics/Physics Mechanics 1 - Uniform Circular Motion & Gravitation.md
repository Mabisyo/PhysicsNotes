# UCM - Concepts and Definitions
*Uniform circular motion describes the motion of an object moving at a constant speed along a circular path. they key concept is that while the speed is constant, the direction of the velocity is continuously changing, resulting in a centripetal acceleration*
______________
### Concepts
- Frequency: How often a repeating event happens. Measured in revolutions per second
- Period: The time for one revolution. Time is in the Numerator (Ref. Equation below)
- Velocity: Direction and thus velocity are continuously changing in circular motion. The magnitude of velocity and speed are not. You can measure an instantaneous velocity, which is tangential to the curve. (Ref. Equation below)
- Centripetal Acceleration: This acceleration is directed toward the center of the circle, caused by the change in direction of the velocity vector. (Ref. Equation below)
- Centripetal Force: If an object is changing direction (accelerating) it must be doing so because a force is acting. Objects follow inertia (in this case the tangential velocity) unless acted upon by an external force. If the object is changing direction to the center of the circle it must be forced that way (Ref. Equation below)
	- Centripetal Force is not a special kind of force, but rather it simply denotes the direction of the net force.
- The difference between Rotational Motion and Circular motion is the following:
	- Rotational Motion: axis of rotation is inside or in conflict with the object
	- Circular Motion: axis of rotation is inside the orbit of the object or outside the object itself
- Acceleration is always perpendicular to the circle and is always perpendicular to the tangential velocity. 
- Acceleration is never equal to zero as long as the circular motion is uniform
- Acceleration has an inverse relationship with the radius of the circular path. 
### Equations
#### Centripetal Acceleration
$$
	a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}
$$
- v = tangential velocity (m/s)
- r = radius of circular path (m)
#### Centripetal Force
$$
	F_c=m*a_c=\frac{mv^2}{r}
$$
- m = mass of the object (kg)
#### Relationship between Period and Frequency
$$
	T = \frac{1}{f}
$$
#### Tangential Velocity in Terms of Period
$$
	v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}
	
$$
#### Centripetal Force in Terms of Angular Velocity
$$
	F_c = m\omega^2r
$$
where:
$$
	\omega= \frac{v}{r} = \frac{2\pi}{T}
$$
#### Centripetal Force & Tangential Velocity: Conic Pendulum
$$
	F_c= mgtan\theta
$$
$$
	v_T=\sqrt{gLsin\theta tan\theta}
$$
#### Centripetal Force & Tangential Velocity: Turning Aeroplane
$$
	F_c=mgtan\theta
$$
$$
	v_T=\sqrt{grtan\theta}
$$
#### Centripetal Force & Tangential Velocity: Flat Curve
$$
	F_c=\mu_s mg
$$
$$
	v_T=\sqrt{\mu_s gr}
$$
#### Centripetal Force & Tangential Velocity: Banked Curve
$$
	F_c=F_Nsin\theta + f_scos\theta
$$
$$
	v_T=\sqrt{\frac{rg(sin\theta + \mu cos\theta)}{(cos\theta - \mu sin\theta)}}
$$

# Gravitation - Concepts and Definitions
*Universal gravitation describes the force of attraction between two masses. This concept is fundamental to understanding planetary motion and satellite dynamics.*
________________
### Concepts & Definitions
- Gravity: One of the fundamental forces. This force is a field force, and the field is g, the acceleration of gravity. every mass in the universe generates a gravity field. The gravity field is directed toward the center of mass. while the nature of the force is not understood the mathematics are detailed in Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.
- Weightlessness simply means that the surface you touch exerts no normal force on you. Normal force is responsible for giving you the perception of weight. Weightlessness means that whatever object you are interacting with has the same acceleration as you do. 
### Equations
#### Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation: 
$$
	F_g=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}
$$
Where:
- G = gravitational constant (6.674 x 10^-11)
- m = mass of object(s)
- r = distance between the centers of the two masses (m)
#### Gravitational Field Strength (g)
$$
	g = \frac{F_g}{m}=G\frac{M}{r^2}
$$
Where:
- M = mass of the planet or object creating the field (kg)
#### Kepler's Third Law
*The square of the orbital period (T) is proportional to the cube of the semi major axis (a)*
$$
	T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}a^3
$$
# AP Exam Tips
- UCM: Since the free-body diagram is supposed to show all the individual forces on an object, and not the components or sums, it should never have a force labeled as the centripetal force.
- UCM: Whenever the velocity of an object changes direction, it accelerates, even if the speed is constant, therefore it must be accelerating towards the center of the circle.
