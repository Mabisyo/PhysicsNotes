_______________
The *Electric Field* is a vector field. The net electric field at any point in space due to a group of source charges is the vector sum of the electric fields due to each individual source charge. 

**Point Charge:** Individual discrete charges
**Continuous Charge Distributions:** Situations where charge is spread out over a line, area, or volume, rather than being concentrated at discrete points. Examples include a charged rod or ring. 
**Charge Densities**: Used to describe how charge is distributed over a continuous object.
