# Fundamental Concepts
___________
## Electric Charge

**Definition**: A fundamental property of matter that causes it to experience electromagnetic forces
**Types of Charges**
- Positive (+): Protons
- Negative (-): Electrons
**Conservation of Charge**: Net charge in an isolated system remains constant
**Quantization of Charge**: Charge exists in discrete packets of electron charge
$$ e = 1.602(10)^{-19}$$
**Conductors vs. Insulators**: 
- Conductors allow free movement of electrons (e.g. metals)
- Insulators resist electron flow (e.g. rubber, glass)
## Coulomb’s Law (Electric Force between Point Charges)

**Equation**:
$$
\vec{F}_e = k_e\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}\widehat{r}
$$
- k sub e is Coulomb’s Constant
- The “q” represent charges (C)
- r represents the distance between charges (m)
- r with wide-hat represents the unit vector in the direction of the force
**Superposition Principle**: Net Force on a charge is the vector sum of all forces from all other charges

## Electric Field (E) due to Point Charges
**Definition**: Force per unit charge experienced by a test charge (initial charge)
**Equation**: 
$$
	\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{F}_e}{q_0}=k_e\frac{q}{r^2}\widehat{r}
$$
***Superposition of Fields***
$$
	\vec{E}\tiny net \normalsize = \sum{\vec{E}_i}
$$
## Key Derivations
**1. Deriving Coulomb’s Law from Gauss’s Law**
- Gauss’s Law: $$\intop{\vec{E}(d\vec{A})=\frac{Q\tiny enc \normalsize}{\epsilon_0}} $$
- For a point charge, symmetry gives: 
$$
	E(4\pi r^2) = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0} \rightarrowtail E = (\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0})(\frac{q}{r^2})=k_e\frac{q}{r^2}
$$
- Thus, force on another charge q initial is: 
$$
	F_e = q_0E=k_e\frac{qq_0}{r^2}
$$
**2. Electric Field of a Dipole**
*For two equal and opposite charges plus or minus q separated by distance d:*
- Along the axial line (x-axis):
$$
	E\tiny dipole \normalsize = \frac{2k_ep}{x^3}; x>>d
$$
where p=qd (dipole moment)
- Along the perpendicular bisector (y-axis)
$$
	E \tiny dipole \normalsize = \frac{k_ep}{y^3}
$$
3. **Acceleration of Any Two Charged Spheres**
- Start with Coulomb’s Law & Equation for Gravity: $$\sum{F_e}=-F_g-F_e$$
$$m_e\vec{a}=-\frac{GM_eM_p}{r^2}-(\frac{kQQ}{r^2})$$
- Multiply both sides by mass: $$\vec{a}=\frac{GM_p}{r^2}-\frac{kQQ}{M_er^2}$$

# Problem-Solving Strategies
______________
**A. Quick Calculations**
- Symmetry Use: If charges are symmetric, cancel out components
- Unit Vectors: Break forces into x,y,z components
- Approximations: For r >> d, use binomial expansion
**B. Common Pitfalls**
- Sign Errors: Remember force direction (attraction vs. repulsion)
- Units: Always use SI 
- Superposition: Don’t forget vector addition
