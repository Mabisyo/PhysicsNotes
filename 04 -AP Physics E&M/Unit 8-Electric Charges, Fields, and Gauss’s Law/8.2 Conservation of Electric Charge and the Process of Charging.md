# Fundamental Concepts
___________
## Conservation of Change
- Charge is always conserved and constant within an isolated system.
#### Methods of Charging
- ***Friction***: Brushing electrons onto another object
- ***Conduction***: Charged objects transferring charge to reach equilibrium  (contact between charges)
- ***Induction***: Shifting charges due to proximity of a net charge (order of operations matters)
	- ***Polarization***: temporary realignment of charges without objects touching
**In Non-Isolated Systems**: 
- Charge is still conserved, but can be exchanged with its surrounding. 
- Always the electrons moving around
- *Grounding*: Connecting a charged object to a much larger and approximately neutral object.
### I. Electric Flux
**Definition**: A measure of the electric field passing through a surface
**Equation**:
$$
	\phi_e=\intop \vec{E}*d\vec{A}=\intop Ecos\theta dA
$$
- dA is the differential area vector (normal to surface)
- Theta represents the angle between Vector E and the differential area vector
- ***Close surface flux***: $$\phi_e=\intop{\vec{E}*d\vec{A}}$$
### Gauss’s Law
**Statement**: The net electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge
**Equation**: 
$$
	\intop{\vec{E}*d\vec{A}}=\frac{Q\tiny enc}{\epsilon_0}
$$
- Epsilon represents the permittivity of free space ()
- Q represents the total charge inside the Gaussian surface
### Key Implications
1. ***Symmetry Matters***: Gauss’s Law is most useful for highly symmetric charge distributions (Spherical, Cylindrical, Planar).
2. ***Outside vs. Inside***: 
	- For a **spherical shell**, E=0 inside (if no charge) and $$E=\frac{k_eQ}{r^2}$$ outside.
	- For an **infinite plane**: $$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}$$
	- For a **Line of Charge**: $$E = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi \epsilon_0 r}$$
# Key Derivations
_________
### I. Gauss’s Law from Coulomb’s Law (Proof)
1. Start with Coulomb’s Law for a point charge: $$\vec{E}=k_e\frac{Q}{r^2}\widehat{r}$$
2. Consider a spherical Gaussian surface of radius r centered on Q
3. The Flux is: $$\phi_e=\int{\vec{E}*d\vec{A}}=E*4\pi r^2$$
4. Substitute E from Coulomb’s Law: $$\phi_e=(\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{r^2})=\frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$$
5. Thus Gauss’s Law is derived
### II. Electric Field of an Infinite Plane (From Gauss’s Law)
1. Choose a cylindrical Gaussian surface (pillbox) perpendicular to the plane
2. Flux through the curved side = 0 since vector E is parallel
3. Flux through the top and bottom: $$\phi_e= 2EA$$ since vector E is uniform.
4. Enclosed charge: $$Q \tiny enc \normalsize = \sigma A$$
5. Apply Gauss’s Law: $$2EA = \frac{\sigma A}{\epsilon_0} \rightarrow E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}$$
# Problem Solving 
____________
***I. Choosing the Right Gaussian Surface***
- **Spherical Symmetry**: Use a concentric sphere
- **Cylindrical Symmetry**: Use a coaxial cylinder
- **Planar Symmetry**: Use a pillbox (cylinder)
***II. Common Pitfalls***
- **Misapplying Symmetry**: Gauss’s Law only simplifies calculations for symmetric cases
- **Ignoring Direction**: Vector E must be constant in magnitude and direction over the Gaussian surface
- **Units**: Ensure Epsilon is in SI
