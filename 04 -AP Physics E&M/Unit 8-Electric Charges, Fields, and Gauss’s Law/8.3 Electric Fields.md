# Fundamental Concepts
______

- Electric Fields may originate from charged particles
- The Electric field at a given point is the ratio of the electric force exerted on a test charge at the point to the charge and the charge on the test charge itself.
- The Electric field points away from an isolated positive charge and towards an isolated negative charge
- The electric force exerted on a positive test charge is in the same direction as the electric field
	- Therefore if the test charge is negative, the electric force points opposite the direction of the electric field. 
- ==Permittivity==: How easily/difficult it is for an electric charge to pass through space (vacuum)
#### Representing Electric Fields:
1. **Vector Maps**: Arrows indicate direction and magnitude (longer arrow = stronger field)
2. **Field Lines**:
	- Direction: Lines originate on positive charges and terminate on negative charges
	- Density: the density of field lines is proportional to the field’s magnitude
	- Rules: Field lines never cross and are always perpendicular to conducting surfaces
## Equations
#### Electric Field (At any Given Point) - Vector Equation
*Unit: N/C → Newtons/Coulomb*
$$E = \frac{F_e}{Q}$$
#### Electric Field due to Point Charge
$$ \vec{E}=k_e \frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}=\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q}{r^2}\hat{r}$$
$$\vec{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\intop{\frac{dQ}{r^2}}\hat{r}$$
- Coulomb’s Constant
- Permittivity of free space
- r hat is the unit vector pointing *from* the source charge to the point of interest
