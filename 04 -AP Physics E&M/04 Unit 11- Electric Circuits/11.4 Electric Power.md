### Electric Power
**Vocab**
- ==*Power*==: The rate of energy dissipation or transformation. Symbol P, Unit W (watt). W=Joules/second
- ==*Work*==: The transformation of energy from one form to another. Symbol W, unit J (Joule)
### The Effects of Power on Resistors
***For lightbulbs***
- ==Filament==: A thin, conducting material with a high melting point and very high resistivity used to create an incandescent bulb
- ==Incandescence==: the production of light by heating a filament until it glows

When resistors, or lightbulbs, have a constant current: to calculate power,

### Power 
1. ***Power*** $$P \tiny avg \normalsize = \frac{W}{\Delta t}= \frac{\Delta E}{\Delta t}$$ $$P=I\Delta V$$ - *I* is current, delta V is voltage $$P=\frac{\Delta V ^2}{R}$$ - Power with a fixed current $$P=I^2R$$
2. Change in Potential Energy $$\Delta U_E=q \Delta V$$
