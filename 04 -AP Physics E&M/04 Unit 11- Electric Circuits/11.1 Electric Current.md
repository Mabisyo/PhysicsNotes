## Electric Current
*Electric Current* (I): 
	The amount of charge (Q) moving through a cross sectional area of a wire in time interval **t**.
- Current is measured in Amps or Amperes (A), which is the number of coulombs of charge per second (C/s).
*Drift Velocity*:
	The net charged particle motion of all the particles within an area

*Electric Current Depends on the following*:
- The number of charged particles per cubic meter of volume
- Quantity of Charge
- Cross sectional area of charge

*Considerations:*
- In order to have current in a wire, there must be an electric potential difference, referred to as electromotive force.
- The individual speed of each charged particle is always greater than the drift speed.

## Charge Flow
- If there is an electric field in a wire, then the charges in that wire will be forced to move.
- If the strength of the electric field is increased, the force is increased, which increases the electric current density and are vectors. 
- Electric current is based on the charges that are moving in a conductor, which does have a direction.
- Electrons in a wire move in the opposite direction of conventional current.

### Electric Current
$$I=\frac{Q}{\Delta t}=\frac{dq}{dt}$$$$I=nqv_dA$$
$$I=\vec{J}•\vec{A}=JAcos\theta$$
$$I=\intop{\vec{J}\cdot d\vec{A}}$$
### Current Density
$$J=\frac{I}{A}=\frac{nqv_dA}{A}=nqv_d$$
*J is current Density*
