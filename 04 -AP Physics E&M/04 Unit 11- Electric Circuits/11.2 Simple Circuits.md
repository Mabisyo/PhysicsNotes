### Review
- The electric current in a wire is based on positive charge flow
- An electric potential difference sets up an electric field in a wire.
- Each charge in the wire moves in random directions with different speeds, but the presence of an electric field will cause them to drift from one end of the wire to the other. 
### Electric Circuit
A **Simple Electric Circuit** is any electric loop that consists of a variety of devices through which electric current could flow. 
- An ***Open Circuit*** is an electric circuit through which electric  electric charges are not able to flow.
- A ***Closed Circuit*** is an electric circuit through which electric charges are able to flow. 
- A ***Short Circuit*** is an electric circuit through which electric charges are able to flow but with no change in electric potential difference. 
### Electric Circuit Composition
- Wires (Provides path for charges to flow)
- Batteries (Where charge is stored or originates from)
- Resistors (What is used to get something out of the circuit)
- Lightbulbs (Type of a resistor)
- Capacitors
- Inductors (AC Current only)
- Switches (An alternate or no path for electricity to flow)
- Ammeters (Measurement device)
- Voltmeters (Measurement device)
### Symbols
**Wires**
- Any wire in a schematic diagram is represented by straight line that connect from one element to the next, typically at right angles.
**Battery**
- The symbol for a battery or series of batteries, uses a long line to represent the high electric potential side of the battery and a short line for the low electric potential side.
**Resistor**
- The symbol for any resistor is a jagged line
**Lightbulb**
- The symbol for any lightbulb is a circle with a loop in the circle
**Capacitor**
- The symbol for a capacitor has two parallel equal length lines
**Inductor**
- The symbol for any inductor is a coil between two lines
**Switch**
- The symbol for open switches are two dots and a diagonal line
- The symbol for a closed switch are two dots and a horizontal line
**Ammeter**
- The symbol for an ammeter is a circle with the letter “A” in its center
**Voltmeter**
- The symbol for a voltmeter is a circle with the letter “V” in its center
