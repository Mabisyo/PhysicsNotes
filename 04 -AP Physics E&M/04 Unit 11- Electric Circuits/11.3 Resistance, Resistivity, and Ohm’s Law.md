***Resistance*** is the opposition of charges moving through a circuit. 
- Symbol R, Unit Omega (Ohm, the Greek letter capital Omega)
***Ohm Meter***- Device used to measure resistance 
- A resistor does not need to be part of the circuit to measure resistance
==***Voltage Drop*** - The amount of voltage a resistor uses in a circuit== (Change in V)
- $$Voltage ≠ Energy$$ but $$V(Q)=Energy$$

Note:
- Current is constant throughout a circuit. When charges interact with a resistor, they speed up ensuring the same number of charges are crossing the same point in same point in the same time interval.
- If a resistor’s resistance is increased, current is decreased. Remember: $$V=IR$$ $$I=\frac{Q}{t}$$ More resistance means the charges are moving faster and colliding in-elastically with the conductor’s atoms more frequently. This dissipates the kinetic energy quicker in a highly resistive material.
- More collisions mean energy is being transformed from the circuit.

***Cross Sectional Area*** - The area of a slice of a 2-dimensional shape that was cut by a plane in the 3rd dimension
***Resistivity*** - Property of material that allows for the prediction of resistance based on the cross-sectional area and length of conductor. (ρ)
***Resistance*** - A property of a conductor that impedes the flow of electric current. Inverse of resistivity is conductivity
***Conventional Current***: the historical, or traditional, explanation of charges moving through circuits from higher potential to a lower potential
### Ohm’s Law & its Limitations
***According to Ohm’s law, high voltage produces high current***
- In Series Circuits, current is the same through each resistor
- In Parallel Circuits, voltage is the same through each resistor
==**Limitations**==:
- Non-Ohmic Materials (Diodes or Transistors)
- Temperature Dependency (Some metals have +/- Temperature Coefficient)
- AC Circuits and Frequency Dependency (Current and Voltage are Constantly Changing in AC)
- Very High Frequencies (Radio Frequency and Microwave Circuits)
==***Solving Circuits***==
1. Collapse Circuit to a few resistors as possible
2. Use Ohm’s Law to find any missing variables
3. Follow each path and use the original resistor values to find voltage/current loss (drop) for each resistor
### Electric Power


# Equations
_________________________________
### Resistance (R)
- Ratio of voltage across the conductor to the current flowing through it. 
$$R= \frac{\Delta V}{I}$$
### Derivation for the Expression for Resistance
- Recall electric field represents the force experienced by a unit of positive charge at a given point in space.
Use the following equations for the derivation: 
$$\array{ E=\frac{\Delta V}{l} & j=\frac{I}{A} \cr R=\frac{\Delta V}{I} \rightarrow & I=\frac{\Delta V}{R} }$$
