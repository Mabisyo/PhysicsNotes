Unit 8: Electric Charges, Fields, and Gauss Law:

R = radius of the sphere
Q = total charge of the sphere
r = distance from the center
E - electric field
K= couloumb's constant
Q = total charge of sphere, rod, system..
lamba = linear charge density 
s.c.d = surface charge density

---1. Electric field from a uniformly charged sphere (inside & outside):

E(r) = (KQ)/(r^2) r>=R (outside)

E(r) = (KQr)/(R^3) (inside) 

Steps: 
Pick a Gaussian surface: sphere of radius r centered on the charge.

Check r: if r < R it's inside, if r >= R it's outside.

Find enclosed charge:

Outside: all charge Q.

Inside: fraction proportional to volume it's Q enclosed = Q * (r^3 / R^3).

Apply Gauss Law:
E * surface_area = Q_enclosed/eps0
Surface_area = 4 * pi * r^2

Solve for E.
Direction: radial, away from center (for positive charge).


---2. Electric field of infinite line of charge

E = (lamba)/(eps0 * 2pi * r) 

Pick a Gaussian surface: cylinder of radius r around the wire.

Use symmetry: field points radially outward.

Flux through cylinder:
flux = E * (2 * pi * r * length)
Q_enclosed = lambda * length
flux = Q_enclosed / e0

And! Solve

---3. Electric field of an infinite plane

E = (s.c.d)/(2eps0)

Pick a Gaussian surface a pillbox that straddles the sheet.

Check symmetry: field perpendicular to sheet, same on both sides.

Flux through pillbox:

flux = (E * top_area) + (E * bottom_area) = 2 * E * A

Q_enclosed = sigma * A

flux = Q_enclosed / e0 → E = sigma / (2 * e0)
